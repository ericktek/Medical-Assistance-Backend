62		CHAPTER THREE HAEMATOLOGY AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION 3.1 Anaemia 3.1.1 Iron Deficiency Anaemia A lack of iron in the body (mainly due to nutritional deficiency, chronic blood loss, malabsorption and hookworm infestations and increased demand such as during pregnancy).  Clinical presentation: fatigue, palpitation, dizziness, glossitis, koilonychias (spoon shaped nails) and pica  Investigations  • Full blood picture (FBP) • Peripheral smear • Iron studies- serum iron levels, total iron binding capacity, serum ferritin   • Stool analysis for hookworm ova and occult blood. If stool for occult blood is positive, do Oesophagoduodenoscopy (OGD) to confirm upper gastrointestinal bleeding  Non-Pharmacological Treatment   • To prevent iron deficiency; o Eat a variety of iron rich foods like meat, eggs, legumes (dried beans, lentils, peas), spinach and dark green leafy vegetables, iron fortified breads and cereals, nuts and seeds. • To help in iron absorption from diet; o Avoid drinking tea/coffee with meals o Increase intake of vitamin C rich foods (e.g. citrus fruit, broccoli, cauliflower, guavas, tomatoes, bell peppers and strawberries) with meals to maintain iron in its reduced state  Pharmacological Treatment  Treat the undelying cause of iron deficiency anaemia. Adults   A: ferrous sulfate (PO) 200mg 8hourly for 3months.  Children: A: ferrous sulphate (PO) 5mg/kg 8hourly. Continue for 3months after the normal hemoglobin has been achieved.     OR B: Blood transfusion (is only indicated if anaemia is life threatening; e.g anaemia in failure, hypoxia.)    OR D: Iron sucrose (IV) 200mg in 100ml0.9% sodium chloride running for 15 minutes once a day three times a week for 2 weeks.   Parenteral iron is indicated in patients who can not tolerate or are refractory to oral iron. • Total cumulative dose = number of 100mg ampoules for Hb increase • Divide the total cumulative dose in 200mg doses, given 24hourly
