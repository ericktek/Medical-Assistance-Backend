Currently in Tanzania \\nthe following b lood components are available for transfusion packed red blood cells, Fresh Frozen \\nPlasma, single unit platelet (plasma rich) and whole blood units.  \\nI. Whole blood\\nOne unit  contains 450mls of blood. It is poor in platelets and clotting factors and can be stored\\nfor 35days at 2-6°C.\\nIndications\\n Exchange transfusion,  open heart surgery, and in  the absence  of PRBCs in\\npatients with acute blood loss and hypovolaemia.74\\tIt can be stored for 35days at 2-6 °C. One unit increases haemoglobin (Hb) level by approximately \\n1g/dl in adult, whereas in children, a dose of 10 -15mls/kg will increase the Hb by about 3g/dl. \\nIndications acute blood loss, exchange transfusion, cardiac patients with Hb level <8g/dl, chronic \\nsymptomatic anaemia with Hb <5g/dl, preoperative patients with Hb level <8g/dl, pre- radiotherapy \\npatients with Hb level <10g/dl, pre and post chemotherapy patients with Hb <9g/dl, and patients \\nadmitted to ICU with Hb <7g/dl.  \\nIII. Platelets\\nA single random donor platelet (RDP) from one  whole blood unit and contains about 5.5X109/L\\nplatelets in 50ml unit. It is stored at room temperature (20 -24°C) and has a life span of 5days.\\nDosage  50mls per 10kg i.e 5 -6 RDP units in adults. In infants < 10kg, the dose is 5mls/kg, one\\nadult therapeut ic dose increases platelet counts  by approximately 20- 40 X109/L.\\nIndications  \\n, Therapeautic thrombocytopenia of platelet counts < 50X109/L with clinical evidence of\\nbleeding.\\n, Prophylactic in patients with platelet counts of  <10 X109/L, <20X109/L with additional risk\\nfactor of bleeding, <50X109/L and planned for minor surgery, <100X109/L with multiple\\ninjuries, or microvascular bleeding, or planned for major surgery. Also, in massive\\ntransfusion to maintain a platelet count of >50X109/L.\\nContraindications  Absolutely contraindicated in heparin induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia \\n(HITT) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Relatively contraindicated in idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) unless a life -threatening bleeding is anticipated.  \\nIV. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)\\nFFP prepared from one unit of whole blood contains about 200 -300mls of plasma. It is stored at -\\n18°C and contains all clotting factors in physiological levels except factors V and VIII which are\\npresent in slightly reduced amount. It has a l ife span of 12 months. Thaw FFP in water bath at 30 -\\n37°C and transfuse within 30 minutes after thawing. It expires 24 hours after thawing.\\nDosage  10-20ml/kg, approximately 4 -6 units for adult, this will raise a minimum of 30% of plasma \\nclotting factors.  \\nIndications haemophilia if factor concentrates not available, patients with significant coagulopathy \\neg DIC, Vitamin K deficiency and massive transfusion, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) \\nor haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) as top up or exchange  plasma transfusion, scoline apnoea, \\nhaemorrhagic disease of the newborn.  \\n ',\n",
