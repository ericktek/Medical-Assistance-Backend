| Lower GI Bleeding           | Gastrointestinal Bleeding   | - Acute, painless LGI bleeding in older adult patients is usually due to colonic diverticula or angiodysplasia                                                                                   | - Colonoscopy contraindicated acutely as increases the risk of perforation; do 6 –8 weeks after to rule out neoplasm            | - Treat high-risk ulcers endoscopically (haemoclips, thermal therapy, or injection therapy) and continuous IV PPI infusion for 72 hours. Blood transfusion to target haemoglobin level of 7 g/dl. Repeat endoscopic therapy for continued bleeding. Surgery or interventional radiology if endoscopic therapy unsuccessful. | - Consider outpatient follow-up or early discharge when: - patient age <60 years - no hemodynamic instability - no evidence of gross rectal bleeding - identification of an obvious anorectal source of bleeding | Not specified                  | According to expert opinion, the blood transfusion threshold for patients with colonic bleeding is a haemoglobin value <9 g/dL. If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, resuscitate the patient before diagnostic studies are performed. Most episodes of LGI bleeding resolve spontaneously. Colonoscopy is recommended early, usually within the first 48 hours of admission, and endoscopic therapy is used to control continued bleeding. If colonoscopy does not identify a discrete lesion or endoscopic therapy does not control the bleeding, interventional angiography or surgery may be indicated. Patients with angiodysplasia in the setting of AS (Heyde Syndrome) may benefit from valve replacement surgery. Surgery and intraoperative enteroscopy are the last diagnostic option. For patients with occult GI bleeding, capsule endoscopy (first choice GIE 2015; 81:889) or deep enteroscopy if unrevealing, repeat endoscopic examinations (upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy), or deep enteroscopy. |

Start with mild topical steroid cream for wet lesions and use ointment for dry skin lesions. If the skin starts scaling (condition becomes chronic), add/apply an emollient such as: emulsifying ointment or liquid paraffin. Note: Potent topical corticosteroids may cause harmful cutaneous and systemic side effects, especially if the use is prolonged or involves extensive body surface. | -                                                                                          |

For recalcitrant cases: S: methot rexate (PO) 7.5-20mg weekly for not less than 3 months OR S: cyclosporine 3-5mg/kg/day up to 3 months Phototherapy Treat any infection (usually bacterial, but occasionally viral - eczema herpeticum). Choice of skin preparations depends on whether lesions are wet (exudative) or dry/lichenified (thickened skin with increased skin markings). If eczema is “weepy,” use saline baths or bathe in: A: Potassium permanganate 1:4000 (0.025%) solution 24 hourly for 2-4 days until dry. Where large areas are involved, give a course of antibiotics for 5-10 days (as for impetigo). After the lesions have dried, apply an aqueous cream for a soothing effect. Start with mild topical steroid cream for wet lesions and use ointment for dry skin lesions. If the skin starts scaling (condition becomes chronic), add/apply an emollient such as emulsifying ointment or liquid paraffin. Note: Potent topical corticosteroids may cause harmful cutaneous and systemic side effects, especially if the use is prolonged or involves extensive body surface. Striae, acne, hyperpigmentation, and hypopigmentation, hirsutism, and atrophy may result. Therefore, avoid long-term use; don’t use on weepy or infected skin. Advise patients NOT to use them as cosmetics (e.g., for skin lightening purposes). Example of Classes of Topical steroids: Very Potent (0.05% clobetasol propionate), Potent (0.1% betamethasone valerate Mometasone furoate), Moderately Potent (0.05% clobetasol butyrate), Mild (1% hydrocortisone). | - | - |
