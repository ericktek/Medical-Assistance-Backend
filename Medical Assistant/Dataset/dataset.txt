62		CHAPTER THREE HAEMATOLOGY AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION 3.1 Anaemia 3.1.1 Iron Deficiency Anaemia A lack of iron in the body (mainly due to nutritional deficiency, chronic blood loss, malabsorption and hookworm infestations and increased demand such as during pregnancy).  Clinical presentation: fatigue, palpitation, dizziness, glossitis, koilonychias (spoon shaped nails) and pica  Investigations  • Full blood picture (FBP) • Peripheral smear • Iron studies- serum iron levels, total iron binding capacity, serum ferritin   • Stool analysis for hookworm ova and occult blood. If stool for occult blood is positive, do Oesophagoduodenoscopy (OGD) to confirm upper gastrointestinal bleeding  Non-Pharmacological Treatment   • To prevent iron deficiency; o Eat a variety of iron rich foods like meat, eggs, legumes (dried beans, lentils, peas), spinach and dark green leafy vegetables, iron fortified breads and cereals, nuts and seeds. • To help in iron absorption from diet; o Avoid drinking tea/coffee with meals o Increase intake of vitamin C rich foods (e.g. citrus fruit, broccoli, cauliflower, guavas, tomatoes, bell peppers and strawberries) with meals to maintain iron in its reduced state  Pharmacological Treatment  Treat the undelying cause of iron deficiency anaemia. Adults   A: ferrous sulfate (PO) 200mg 8hourly for 3months.  Children: A: ferrous sulphate (PO) 5mg/kg 8hourly. Continue for 3months after the normal hemoglobin has been achieved.     OR B: Blood transfusion (is only indicated if anaemia is life threatening; e.g anaemia in failure, hypoxia.)    OR D: Iron sucrose (IV) 200mg in 100ml0.9% sodium chloride running for 15 minutes once a day three times a week for 2 weeks.   Parenteral iron is indicated in patients who can not tolerate or are refractory to oral iron. • Total cumulative dose = number of 100mg ampoules for Hb increase • Divide the total cumulative dose in 200mg doses, given 24hourly                63		Table 3.1: Number of 100mg/ampoules of iron sucrose needed for Hb increase based on the body weight. 
 • Duration of treatment may extend to 4 weeks based on the total cumulative dose required. • Monitor blood counts and clinical assessment monthly.  Note  Formulations of iron combined with other nutritional supplements (vitamins, 0.4mg-5mg folic acid, zinc and amino acids) are recommended to enhance absorption of iron and correct combined nutritional deficiencies.   3.1.2 Megaloblastic Anemia This is a condition whereby the bone marrow usually produces large, structurally abnormal, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts) often due to inadequate intake or malabsorption of vitamin B12 or folate.   Clinical presentation  Pallor, depression, hair loss, pins and needles, numbness in hands or feet, tremors and palsies, mildly jaundiced (lemon yellow tint), beefy tongue, darkening of palms and ataxic gait.  Investigations • FBC-Low Hb, sometime pancytopenia, raised mcv but maybe low or normal if coexisting with iron deficiency (combined deficiency anaemia) • Peripheral smear • Serum vitamin B12,  • Serum folate level,  • TSH • Reticulocyte count • Bone marrow aspiration may be indicated  Pharmacological Treatment Vitamin (B12 deficiency anaemia) and other macrocytic without neurological involvement.  C: hydroxycobalamine (IM) initially 1mg 3times a week for 2weeks then 1mg (IM) every 3months.  Review the patient’s blood counts and clinical assessment every 3months.    Pernicious Anaemia (B12 deficiency) with neurological symptoms and signs  C: hydroxycobalamine (IM) initially 1mg on alternate days until no further improvement (maximum reversal or neuro-psychiatric signs and symptoms are achieved) then 1mg every 2-3months   AND A: folic acid (PO) 5mg 24hourly for at least 3months this must be started simultaneously with injection vitamin B12    AND A: ferrous sulphate (PO) 200mg 8hourly for at least 3months.   
64	3.1.3 Haemolytic Anaemia 
Haemolytic anaemia results from an increase in the rate of red cell destruction in the intrava scular or 
in the reticuloendothelial system in some pathological disorders  
Clinical presentation : 
• Pallor, jaundice, splenomegaly
• Anaemia, Reticulocytosis, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and haemoglobinuria

3.1.4   Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)  
Clinical presentation  
The clinical mani festations of SCA are variable; 
• Symptoms usually occur after 6 months of life.
• acute onset of unexplained illness, including acute pain, anaemia, acute neurological
symptoms, loss of vision, respiratory infections, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, swollenlimbs and sepsis.
• Four types of crises occur in SCD; vaso -occlussive crisis, hemolytic crisis, sequestration
crisis, aplastic crisis.
Investigations  
Screening test: sickling test, isoelectric focusi ng (electrophoretic separation)  
Confirmatory Tests: Sickle Scan, haemoglobin electrophoresis , HPLC (High performance Liquid 
Chromatography)  
Other ancillary laboratory investigations useful in detection and monitoring of the disease include: 
• FBP, Reticulocyte count, Peripheral
blood film, 
• Blood culture and sens itivity,
• LDH, total and indirect bilirubin,
liver and renal profile, 
• POC blood gases, ECG,
• mRDT, RBG,
• Blood grouping and cross match,
• Imaging eg CXR, ECHO,
Ultrasounds (abdominal and 
transcranial doppler TCD USS), 
and CT Scan head if suspicious of 
stroke.65	Note  
Confirmatory test should be done to all patients with positive screening tests and those with 
negative screening test results but have clinical presentation suggestive of SCD.  
Screening  
From the age of 10 years, screen for renal disease (protei nuria by urine dipstick) and retinopathy 
annually

A: pneumococc al conjugate vaccine (PCV -13) from two months of age, 3 doses 8 weeks 
apart (i.e at age 2months, 4 months and 6 months ) and a booster dose between 12 -15 
months. If the child has not previously received this vaccine, then at least one  dose should 
be given betwee n 6-18 years. PCV -13 and vaccine against H. influenza  is incorporated in 
Tanzania EPI schedule.

Indications for use of Hydroxyurea Include:  
All children older than nine months with proven SCD; and  
In adolescents and adults with the followi ng;  66		• Recurrent vaso-occlussive crisis (3 or more severe episodes requiring admission in the last 12 months), • Severe and/or recurrent acute chest syndrome (ACS) (2 or more episodes in a lifetime), • Severe symptomatic chronic anemia that interferes with daily activities or quality of life,  • Where chronic transfusion therapy is not feasible use it as an alternative to prevent new or recurrent stroke,  • Silent infarcts, stroke and in patients with abnormal TCD (199cm/sec), • Recurrent priapism,  • Chronic kidney disease on erythropoietin to improve anaemia.  Principle of Dosage Initiation and Monitoring: S: hydroxyurea (PO) 15 mg/kg/day 24hourly; (5–10 mg/kg/day if patient has chronic kidney disease).  S: hydroxyurea (PO) 20mg/kg/day, starting dosage for infants and children.    Increase the dose by 2.5–5 mg/kg/day every 3 months,Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) should not exceed 30mg/kg/day.  Blood work monitoring • Bi-monthly FBP, reticulocyte count for 1 month, then monthly for 3months, then once every 3months if blood counts remain stable. • HbF % analysis, liver function test, serum creatinine and urea every 6months. • Weigh patient every three months and adjust the dosage accordingly.  Threshold for dose reduction • Neutrophil ANC < 1.5 X109/L • Reticulocyte count < 80 X1012/L • Platelet count < 80 X109/L • Hb < 6g/dl  If haematologic toxicity occurs; • Discontinue hydroxyurea until counts recover, usually 1-2 weeks, • Reinitiate hydroxyurea at a dose 2.5 mg/kg/day less than the dose given before onset of cytopenias to achieve the maximum tolerable therapeautic dose,  • Do FBP according to the initiation schedule. Note • Clinical response to treatment with hydroxyurea may take 3-6months. A 6month trial on MTD is required before considering discontinuation due to treatment failure. • Hydroxyurea should be stopped at least three months prior to conception in both males and females  • Hydroxyurea should be discontinued in all pregnant women • Hydroxyurea should be discontinued in all breastfeeding women  Blood transfusion in SCA Simple (Top-Up) Blood Transfusion:  Indicated in symptomatic anaemia, orhaemoglobin level has dropped by > 2g/dl below the steady-state value.   Exchange Blood Transfusion:  Aim to reduce HbS to 30%.   Indications for Exchange Blood Transfusion • Cerebrovascular Accidents (CVAs)  • Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS)  • Prior to major surgery  • Multi-organ failure, including Systemic Marrow Fat Embolism (SMFE)  • Multiple pregnancies  • Prevention of recurrent stroke.  67	Relative Indications for Exchange Blood Transfusion  
• Intractable or very frequent severe cr ises
• Major priapism unresponsive to other therapy.
Note 
• Because the cardiovascular system adjusts to the chronic anaemia, blood transfusion is not
routinely indicated in steady state SCD simply for the reason that haemoglobin level is below 8 –
10g/dl.
• Packed red cells transfusion is preferred to minimize the risk of fluid overload
SCD in pregnancy  
• Stop hydroxyurea 3 months before conception
• Educate the patient about the risks associated with pregnancy in SCD.
• Determine the haemoglobinopathy status of  the partner.
• Document pre -pregnancy baseline results if any.
• Refer the patient to a high -risk antenatal clinic for proper follow up
• Prescribe routine prenatal vitamins, see under Obstetric and gynaecology chapter
• Prophylactic blood transfusion is not reco mmended.
• Vaginal delivery is preferred unless there is indication for caesarian section.
• Prescribe prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) for patients with additional risk
factors for VTE e.g history of VTE. See details under coagulation disorders se ction 3.5
• Monitor hydration status, warmth and give analgesia as needed after delivery.
• Assess and manage neonatal opioid dependency and withdrawal all infants with history ofin utero opioid exposure
.

3.2    Bleeding Disorders  
3.2.1 Hereditary Bleeding Disorders  
Hereditary bleeding disorders includes haemophilia A and B, Von Willebrand disease 
3.2.1.1 Haemophilia 
Haemophilia is an inherited, X -linked lifelong bleeding disorder which affects males almost 
exclusively.  
Clinica l presentation  
•Spontaneous muscle and joint bleeding without injury,
•Prolonged bleeding after injury,
•Epistaxis and easy brui sing.
•Complication includes arthropathy and disability.
Haemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency)  
Is the most common of the hereditary clotting factor deficiencies and are caused by deficiency of 
factor VIII.  
Haemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency)  
•It is caus ed by deficiency of clotting factor IX
•Presentation as in Haemophilia A, this is less common 20%.
Classification  of Haemophilia  
Haemophilia is classified as mild, moderate or severe according to the levels of circulating factor VIII or IX and indicates t he expected frequency of bleeding.  70	Classificati

other medical/pharmaceutical personnel
•Genetic counselling
•For Acute Bleeding episodes (RICE): Rest, Ice/cold pack – 5 minutes on, 10 min off,
Compression and Elevate the joint.
For haemarthrosis – AVOID incising or aspiration of the affected joint.  Treat by replacing the 
specific factor e.g factor 8 or 9 concentrate if available or FFP (10 - 15ml/kg), joint support and tabs 
Paracetamol for pain.  
Pharmacological Treatment  
Avoid use of NSAIDs, instead use paracetamol 
Haemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency) no Inhibitor  
Dose depends on bleeding severity  
Minor bleed: 
S: Factor VIII  (IV) 20–40IU/kg.  
Major bleed:  
S: Factor VIII (IV) 50 –100 IU/kg 12hourly for 3 -5days or until bleeding stops 
Expected response:  1IU/kg = 2% rise in factor VIII level  
Half life Factor VIII: 8 –24hours  
Haemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency) no inhibitor  
Dose depends on bleeding severity  
Minor bleed:  
S: Factor IX (IV) 20-50IU/kg 
Major bleed:  
S: Factor  IX (IV) 100IU/kg  
Expected response:  1IU/kg= 1.5 rise in the factor IX level 
Half-life Factor IX: 16 –24 hrs 
D: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be used where factor concentrate is unavailable. 
Average dose 10 -15mls/kg 
Note  
• If there is no response to ap propriate replacement therapy tests for inhibitors (an inhibitor is
formed when one develops antibodies against factor concentrates)
• Detection of inhibitor is by aPTT mix study and confirmed by Bethesda assay (BU)
Factor VIII Inhibitor M anagement Options  
•High dose factor concentrate infusion
•Use by -pass agent like FEIBA (Factor Eight Inhibitor By -passing Agent)Table 3.3 : Classification of Haemophilia  71		• Immune tolerance induction therapy (ITI) • In case of emergency surgery consider plasmapheresis • Adjuvant antifibronolytic agents eg Tranexamic acid can used with either of the above  Note • All patients suspected with haemophilia A or B refer to higher facility with adequate expertise or consult haematology Unit. • Children with severe haemophilia are recommended to be on low dose prophylaxis of factor concentrate • Male circumcision should be done at a hospital where factor concentrate is available. Concentrate should be given before and after the procedure.  3.2.2 Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) Von Willebrand Disease is inherited disease due to deficiency of vWF. It is the commonest bleeding disorder in the population especially in women.  Clinical presentation • History of easy bruising,  • Menorrhagia • Gum bleeding • Joint bleeding in severe cases  Investigations • Confirmatory test: VWF level assay. • PT, aPTT, and platelet count are normal except in severe cases.   Pharmacological Treatment    C: etamsylate (PO) 500mg 8hourly until the bleeding stop    OR  C: tranexamic acid (PO) 500mg 8hourly until bleeding is stopped.  If no response    S: Desmopresin (IV) 0.3µg/kg IV stat. Max. Dose20µg.  Note: • Patient unresponsive to DDVAP may be treated with virus-inactivated vWF containing FVIII concentrate. • Never give Etamsylate or Tranexamic acid to patients bleeding per urethral   3.2.3 Acquired Bleeding Disorders/Platelet Disorders 3.2.3.1 Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) Clinical features • Usually are related to the underlying disorder. • Bleeding manifestation, • Extensive organ dysfunction,  • Shock, renal cortical ischemia, coma, delirium and focal neurological symptoms.  Pharmacological Treatment Rapid and appropriate treatment of the underlying disorder including; • Antibiotics for infection, • Surgical debridement of necrotic tissues,  • Chemotherapy for malignant causes,  • Evacuation of dead fetus;  • Platelets transfusion for thrombocytopenia,  • Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for coagulation factor depletion.  • Monitor prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin (aPTT), platelet count and fibrinogen.  72	Note:  If patient is not ble eding Platelets concentrate is contraindicated. If DIC is severe enough to 
cause multiorgan dysfunction, management in an intensive care unit is required.  
3.2.3.2 Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)  
Clinical features:  
•long history of Purpura, menorr hagia, epistaxis and gingival haemorrhage.
•Intracerebral haemorrhage occurs infrequently but is the most cause of death
•overt bleeding is rare unless thrombocytopenia severe (less than 10 X 109/L)
Note  
A palpable spleen strongly suggests that ITP is NOT  the cause for thrombocytopenia.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
•Patients with platelet counts over 50 X109/L usually do not have spontaneous bleeding and
may undergo invasive procedure .
•Emergency treatment of acute bleeding caused by severe thrombocytopeni a need
immediate platelet transfusion
Pharmacological Treatment  
A: prednisolone (PO) 1mg/kg/day for 3 –6 weeks, then taper 10mg weekly (For all patients 
with platelet counts below 30 X109/L)

4days.  
If no response; 
S:human  Immunoglobulin  G (IV) 0.4g/kg/day for 5days, 
OR 
S:human Immunoglobulin G  (IV) 1g/kg/day for 2days followed by immediately platelets 
transfusion  
3.3 Coagulation Disorders  
Venous thromboemb olism (VTE) is a common disorder that comprises deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
and pulmonary embolism (PE). In most cases, pulmonary embolism arises from proximal deep vein 
thrombosis i.e. popliteal, femoral or iliac veins in at least 90%.  
3.3.1 Deep Vein Thr ombosis (DVT)  
Clinical presentation  
•Leg pain, tenderness and swelling.
•A palpable cord representing thrombosed vessels.
•Discoloration, venous distention and prominence of superficial veins and cyanosis.
•The clinical diagnosis of DVT is highly nonspecific.
Investigations  
•D-dimer,
•Doppler USS,
•PT, INR, Aptt
Pharmacological Treatment 
Long term anticoagulati on is requir ed to prevent a frequenc y of symptomatic extensi on of 
thrombosis and/or recurren t venous thromboembolic events . Warfarin is started with initial 
unfractionat ed hepari n or enoxapari ne ther apy and t hen ov erlapped for 5days. 
C: warfarin (PO) 5mg 24hourly for 5days, then adjust the dose according to INR 
levels for 3 -6 months.  
AND 73	S: Low Molecular weight heparin (SC)1mg/kg 24hourly for 5days  
OR 
S: Unfractionated heparin (IV) by 75units/kg followed by continuous infusion of  
18units/kg/hrs.  
Adolescents or children: loading dose 75units/kg then 15 –25 Units /kg/hr by IV infusion or 
250units/kg 12hourly by SC injection.  
S: rivaroxaban (PO) 15m g 12hourly for 21days, then rivaroxaban (PO) 20mg 24hourly for 
the remaining duration of treatment.  
Pregnant women  
Warfarin is teratogenic, therefore low molecular weight heparin is recommended during pregnancy.  
D: Low Molecu lar weight heparin (SC) 1mg/kg  12hourly for the whole duration of treatment. 
3.3.2 Pulmonary Embolism (PE) 
It is a medical emergency.  
Clinical presentation  
•Transient dyspnea and tachypnea in the absence of other clinical features
•Pleuritic chest pain, cough, haemoptysis, pleural effusion, and pulmonary infiltrate
•Severe dyspnea and tachypnea and right -side heart failure
•Cardiovascular collapse with hypotension, syncope, and coma
•Several less common and nonspecific presentation including unexplained tachycardia or
arrhythmia, resistant  cardiac failure, wheezing, cough, fever, apprehension and confusion.
Investigations  
• PT, INR, aPTT, D-d imer, CXR and CT angiography
Pharmacological Treatment
Treat as Deep Vein Thrombosissection 3.3.1 
Note  
•Warfarin therapeutic INR ranges from 2 to 3 for  VTE, and 2.5 -3.5 for patients with
mechanical heart valves
•Warfarin therapy should be monitored by INR after 5 –7 days of treatment, then as needed
throughout the duration of treatment.
•If the cause of VTE is acquired thromboembolism, treatment lasts for  3-6 months, BUT if the
cause is inherited thrombophilia, treatment is lifelong.
•Warfarin interacts with many drugs therefore precaution should be taken when administered
with other drugs.
•If warfarin overdose/toxicity occurs, stop warfarin and give FFP 1 0-15mls/kg and vitamin K
5mg IV stat. Reinitiate warfarin after bleeding has stopped and INR is within therapeutic
range, using the lower dosage.
•For VTE prophylaxis in bedridden patients, give enoxaparin 40mg SC OR Rivarox aban
10mg orally once a day unti l ambulation resume.
•Unfractionated heparin should be monitored by aPTT before and during treatment.
3.4 Blood Transfusion  
Blood components  
A single donation of blood can be separated into several blood components. Currently in Tanzania 
the following b lood components are available for transfusion: packed red blood cells, Fresh Frozen 
Plasma, single unit platelet (plasma rich) and whole blood units.  
I. Whole blood
One unit  contains 450mls of blood. It is poor in platelets and clotting factors and can be stored
for 35days at 2-6°C.
Indications:
 Exchange transfusion,  open heart surgery, and in  the absence  of PRBCs in
patients with acute blood loss and hypovolaemia.74	It can be stored for 35days at 2-6 °C. One unit increases haemoglobin (Hb) level by approximately 
1g/dl in adult, whereas in children, a dose of 10 -15mls/kg will increase the Hb by about 3g/dl. 
Indications: acute blood loss, exchange transfusion, cardiac patients with Hb level <8g/dl, chronic 
symptomatic anaemia with Hb <5g/dl, preoperative patients with Hb level <8g/dl, pre- radiotherapy 
patients with Hb level <10g/dl, pre and post chemotherapy patients with Hb <9g/dl, and patients 
admitted to ICU with Hb <7g/dl.  
III. Platelets
A single random donor platelet (RDP) from one  whole blood unit and contains about 5.5X109/L
platelets in 50ml unit. It is stored at room temperature (20 -24°C) and has a life span of 5days.
Dosage:  50mls per 10kg i.e 5 -6 RDP units in adults. In infants < 10kg, the dose is 5mls/kg, one
adult therapeut ic dose increases platelet counts  by approximately 20- 40 X109/L.
Indications  
• Therapeautic: thrombocytopenia of platelet counts < 50X109/L with clinical evidence of
bleeding.
• Prophylactic in patients with platelet counts of:  <10 X109/L, <20X109/L with additional risk
factor of bleeding, <50X109/L and planned for minor surgery, <100X109/L with multiple
injuries, or microvascular bleeding, or planned for major surgery. Also, in massive
transfusion to maintain a platelet count of >50X109/L.
Contraindications:  Absolutely contraindicated in heparin induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia 
(HITT) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Relatively contraindicated in idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) unless a life -threatening bleeding is anticipated.  
IV. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
FFP prepared from one unit of whole blood contains about 200 -300mls of plasma. It is stored at -
18°C and contains all clotting factors in physiological levels except factors V and VIII which are
present in slightly reduced amount. It has a l ife span of 12 months. Thaw FFP in water bath at 30 -
37°C and transfuse within 30 minutes after thawing. It expires 24 hours after thawing.
Dosage:  10-20ml/kg, approximately 4 -6 units for adult, this will raise a minimum of 30% of plasma 
clotting factors.  
Indications: haemophilia if factor concentrates not available, patients with significant coagulopathy 
eg DIC, Vitamin K deficiency and massive transfusion, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 
or haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) as top up or exchange  plasma transfusion, scoline apnoea, 
haemorrhagic disease of the newborn.  
 Investigations 
• Before transfusion:FBC, ABO and Rh -blood grouping and crossmatch (cross matching not
needed for platelets and FFP transfusion),
• If transfusion adverse reaction occ urs: Assess for haemolysis (FBC, peripheral smear,
direct antiglobulin test, serum bilirubin, serum LDH), re -grouping and crossmatch, other
tests depending on the type of transfusion reaction.
 Types of blood transfusion  
I. Acute simple/episodic transfusion
Used in management of symptomatic patients with anaemia or bleeding tendencies  
II. Chronic/top up transfusion
Used as prophylactic to prevent complications, eg. In patients  with sickle cell anaemia (SCA)  
III. Exchange blood transfusion
Used in management of se vere neonatal jaundice, in patients with SCA with acute chest syndrome,

NOTIFIABLE DISEASES 
Notifiable Diseases, conditions and events usually pose a great public health threat, with a potential 
of international spread. They require immediate notification by he alth personnel (clinical, laboratory, 
environmental, etc.), to health authorities, as required by the International Health Regulations (IHR 
2005). Notification is mandatory, in order  to ensure prompt and effective response, to avoid further 
spread and to p revent deaths.   
Note:  
• Immediately notify the Public Health Authorities using the electronic reporting system for
priority diseases, i.e. the electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (e -
IDSR) System
• Ensure that the disease, condition or ev ent is recorded in the Health Facility e -IDSR
reporting booklet
• Manage patients on site, in an isolation ward/room or an established isolation centre
• Use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) before attending a suspected patient
• Strictly apply principles of IPC during patient management and waste disposal
4.1 Bacterial Infections 
4. 1.1 Cholera
Cholera is an acute gastrointestinal infection caused by Vibrio cholerae . Infection occurs through 
ingestion of contaminated water or food by Vibrio cholerae  leading  to severe diarrhoea and emesis 
associated with body fluid and electrolyte depletion. 
Clinical Presentation 
• A sudden onset of pa inless watery diarrhoea that may quickly become severe with profuse
watery stool, vomiting, severe dehydration and muscular cramps, leading to hypovolemic 
shock and death  
Case Definition 
• Suspected cholera case: In areas where a cholera outbreak has not been declared: Any
patient aged two years and older presenting with acute watery diarrhoea and severe 
dehydration or dying from acute watery diarrhoea  
• In areas where a cholera outbreak is declared: any person presenting with or dying from
acute watery diarrhoea 
• Confirmed cholera case: A suspected case with Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139 confirmed by
culture or PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). 
Laboratory Investigation  
• Specimen: Liquid stool or rectal swab
• Diagnostic test: Isolate V. cholerae from stool culture a nd determine O1 serotype using
polyvalent antisera for V. cholerae O1. If desired, confirm identification with Inaba and 
Ogawa antisera.  
• If specimen is not serotypable, consider, V. cholerae O139
• Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing   before provision of ant ibiotics; Follow up 48 -72 hours
after antibiotic initiation 
Note 
• For confirmation at the beginning of an outbreak, rectal swab or stool specimen should
be taken from first 5 to 10 suspected cases. 
• If any are positive, every tenth case will be sampled for specimen throughout theNote  
Rational approaches to case management of cholera with oral and intravenous rehydration therapy 
have reduced the case fatality of cholera from more than 50% to much less than 1%. When a case 
of cholera is suspected at home, advise to rehydrate the patient using ORS if available while 
preparing to take the patient to the nearest health facility or Cholera Treatment Centre  78	outbreak  
• Manage a suspected cholera case in an isolation ward or in an established Cholera
Treatment Centre 
Prevention  
• Drink treated or boiled water from safe sources (taps, decontaminated deep wells, bottles)
• Boil water or  treat to kill bacteria and make it safe for drinking and for other domestic uses
• Wash hands with liquid soap and running water after visiting the toilet, before preparing
foods, and before eating 
• DO NOT eat uncooked food from the street and do not eat co oked food that is no longer
hot 
• DO NOT eat street prepared fruits. Always eat home prepared fresh fruits
Management 
Pharmacological Treatment  
Cholera requires immediate treatment because the disease can cause death within hours. There are 
three elements of treatment: Rehydration, Antibiotic Treatment, Zinc and Folic Acid Supplements.  
i. Rehydration
• Assess the patient's level of dehydration as per National Guidelines for Prevention and
Control of Cholera. It is of paramount importance to make correct dia gnosis and administer 
the right treatment. 
o plan A: No dehydration,
o plan B: Moderate dehydration and
o plan C: Severe dehydration.
For Severe dehydration:  
• Administer intravenous (IV) fluid immediately to replace fluid deficit; Use Ringer Lactate
solution or, if that is not available, 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Give 100 ml/kg IV in 3
hours, 30 ml/kg as rapidly as possible (within 30 min) then 70 ml/kg in the next 2.5 hours.
• After the initial 30 ml/kg has been administered, the radial pulse should be s trong and
blood pressure should be normal. If the pulse is not yet strong, continue to give IV flui d
rapidly. Administer ORS solution (about 5 ml/kg/hour) as soon as the patient can drink, inaddition to IV fluid.
• If the patient can drink, begin giving A: oral rehydration salt solution (ORS) by mouth whil
e
the drip is being set up; ORS can provide the potassium, bicarbonate, and glucose tha t
saline solution lacks.
Note  
When using 0.9% sodium chloride solution there is a possibility of hyper -metabolic Aci dosis causing 
kidney injury 
ii. Antibiotic treatment
Antibiotic treatment to patients with severe dehydration is as follows: 
Adults (Not for pregnant women)  
A: doxycycline (PO) 300 mg or 5mg/kg stat then 200mg (PO) 12 hourly for 7 days 
OR 
A: ciprofloxacin (PO) 1g stat then 15mg/kg 12 hourly for 7 days   or 500mg (PO) 12 hourly 
for 7 days  
OR 
A: azithromycin (PO) 500mg once a day for 7 days 
Expectant mothers:  
A: erythromycin (PO) 500mg 8 hourly for 7 days 
Children:  
A: erythromycin syrup (PO) 12.5mg/kg 6 hourly for 5 days 
OR 
A: Azithromycin 250mg (PO) once a day for 7 days 79	For adolescents:  
A: ciprofloxacin (PO) 12mg/kg2 times for 5 days 
OR 
A: doxycycline (PO) 300mg as stat or 5mg/kg (PO) stat  
OR 
A: azithromycin (PO) 500mg once a day for 7 days 
Note  
• Ciprofloxacin was previously contraindicated to children under 12 years. Recent studies
have shown it to be safe for use in children
• Start feeding 3 -4 hours after oral rehydration begins. Preferably, give antibiotics with food
to minimize vomiting
For moderate Dehydration  
• Give oral rehydration, approximately 75 -100ml/kg in the first four hours
• Reassess after four hours; if improved, continue giving WHO based ORS, in quantity
corresponding to losses (e.g. after each stool) or 10 to 20ml/kg. If not improved, treat a s
severe dehydration.
If no signs of dehydration  
• Patients who have no signs of dehydration when first observed can be treated at home
• Give these patients ORS packets to take home, enough for 2 days
• Demonst rate how to prepare and give the solution
• Instruct the patient or the caretaker to return if any of the following signs develop ;
increased number of watery stools repeated vomiting or any signs indicating otherproblems (e.g. fever, blood in stool)
For eac h loose stool or vomiting give;  
• 50-100 ml ( ¼ - ½ cup) of ORS solution for a child less than 2 years old.
• 100-200 ml for older children. Adults can take as much as they want
Note  
Prophylactic treatment of cholera contacts with antibiotics is not recommende d. Routine treatment of 
a community with antibiotics, or mass chemoprophylaxis, has no effect on the spread of cholera, can 
have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security.  
iii. Zinc and Folic Acid Suppl ements
• Zinc (PO) 20mg once daily decreases diarrhea and shortens the duration of illness i n
children with cholera.
• Provide zinc supplementation, at a dosage of 20 milligrams per day for children older than
six months or 10 mg per day for those younger than six months, for 10 –14 days.  
• Folic acid (PO)2.5mg once daily for children < 6 months, or 5mg once daily for children >6
months for the duration of the treatment. For Pregnant women use Folic acid (PO) 5mg
once daily for the duration of the treatment.
Publ ic Health Control Measures 
• Establish treatment centre in locality where cases occur. Treat cases onsite rather than
referring them to treatment centers elsewhere.
• Initiate a line listing of suspected and confirmed cases and ensure laboratory results are
linked with cases
• Strengthen case management
• Mobilize community early to enable rapid case detection and treatment.
• Work with community leaders to limit the number of large gatherings, if seen mandatory,
establish by- laws
• Ensure availability and continuou s access to clean and safe water.
• Promote safe preparation of food, including fruits, and vegetables
• Promote safe disposal of human waste.
• Ensure adequate collaboration with various sectors including water and sanitation toensure appropriate interventio ns are addressed.80	Note  
Cholera Vaccine is available however its utilization must be accompanied with strategies to 
improve water and sanitation  
4.1.2 Anthrax 
Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by the spore forming Bacillus anthraces , a gram positive,  rod-
shaped bacterium. It is a zoonotic disease whereby man is infected directly through contact with 
infected hides or inhalation of spores in the lungs or ingestion of infected meat. It can be manifest on 
the skin (Cutaneous Anthrax) in the lungs (Pulmon ary / Inhalation Anthrax), and/or intestinal 
(Gastrointestinal Anthrax and Oropharyngeal anthrax) or CNS ( Meningeal Anthrax ). 
Clinical Presentation 
Cutaneous Anthrax  
• Itching
• Pruritic papule or vesicle
• Characteristic depressed black eschar surrounded by m oderate to severe edema
• A malignant pustule,
• Pyrexia
Inhalation Anthrax  
Mild inhalation Anthrax 
• Cough, Fever, Fatigue, Myalgia, can resemble a viral respiratory illness, Pulmonary and
gastrointestinal signs may occur together 
• 
Severe inhalation Anthrax  
• Diaphoresis, Stridor, Dyspnea, Hypotension, Acute respiratory distress
These patients may develop sepsis accompanied by cyanosis, shock, and hemorrhagic pneumonia. 
Hemorrhagic pleural effusions often develop.  
Gastrointestinal Anthrax  
• Fever, Abdominal pai n, Vomiting, Diarrhea Bloody stool.
Oropharyngeal anthrax 
Signs of oropharyngeal anthrax may include Dysphagia with posterior oropharyngeal necrotic ulcers, 
Unilateral neck swelling, Cervical adenopathy, Edema, Pharyngitis fever.  
Meningeal Anthrax  
Hemor rhagic meningoencephalitis that involves both 
• Deep brain parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions
• Infection of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the subarachnoid space
Case Definition 
Suspected Case : Any person with acute onset illness characterized by several c linical forms which 
are: 
• Cutaneous form : Any person with skin lesion evolving over 1 to 6 days from a papular
through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar invariably accompanied by oedema
that may be mild to extensive.  
• Gastro -intestinal: Any perso n with abdominal distress characterized by nausea, vomiting,
anorexia and followed by fever  
• Pulmonary (inhalation):  Any person with brief prodromal resembling acute viral
respiratory illness, followed by rapid onset of hypoxia, dyspnoea and high temperatur e, 
with X- ray evidence of mediastinal widening 
• Meningeal:  Any person with acute onset of high fever possibly with convulsions, loss of
consciousness, meningeal signs and symptoms; commonly noted in all systemic 
infections, but may present without any other  clinical symptoms of anthrax.  
AND 
Has an epidemiological link to confirmed or suspected animal cases or contaminated animal 
products?  81		Confirmed case: A confirmed case of anthrax in a human can be defined as a clinically compatible case of cutaneous, inhalational or gastrointestinal illness that is laboratory-confirmed by: (a) Isolation of B. anthracis from an affected tissue or site; or (d) Other laboratory evidence of B. anthracis infection based on at least two supportive laboratory tests.  Laboratory Investigation  • Isolation of Bacillus anthracis from a clinical specimen (e.g. blood, lesions, discharges) • Demonstration of B. anthracis in a clinical specimen by microscopic examination of stained smears (vesicular fluid, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, stools)  • Positive serology (ELISA, Western blot, toxin detection, chromatographic assay, fluorescent antibody test). • Detection of nucleic acid by PCR.  Other supporting tests • Measurement of antibodies or toxin in blood • Chest X-ray  • Computerized tomography (CT) scan • Detection of B. anthracis by nucleic acid test (NAT) covering the genes coding for capsule and virulence factors;   Prevention: Post Exposure Prophylaxis • A: Initial 10-day exposure: ciprofloxacin (PO)500 mg 12hourly for5 daysor doxycycline100 mg(PO)  12 hourly (or, if pathogens are documented to be susceptible phenoxymethyl penicillin) may be used Adults: phenoxymethyl penicillin(PO) 250-500 mg 6 hourly.  Children 1-5 years: phenoxymethyl penicillin(PO)125 mg 6 hourly.  6-12 years: phenoxymethyl penicillin(PO)250 mg6 hourly 48 hours’ exposure:  OR • S: clindamycin(PO) 150 to 300 mg 6 hourly for 5days OR  • S: levofloxacin(PO)500 mg 12hourly for5 daysare alternative antimicrobial prophylaxis to the local population within 48 hours of the initial exposure   Pharmacological Treatment  A: benzylpenicillin(IV)0.6 MU 6 hourly until local oedema subsides then continue with A: phenoxymethy lpenicillin (IV)250 mg 6 hourly for 7 days  If not responding change to  A: doxycycline(PO)200mg initial dose then 100mg 12 hourly for 7 days  OR  A: ciprofloxacin(PO)500mg12 hourly for 7 days AND  A: paracetamol(PO)15mg/kg 8 hourly for 5days In severe forms ADD  Dexamethasone(PO) 0.6 mg/kg per day in divided doses every 8 hours for 4 days  Public Health Control Measures • Standard infection control precautions (IPC) should be used when managing patients with particular attention to body fluid spills, as organisms which remain on surfaces may form spores which are infectious • Personal protective equipment should be used in situations where there is potential for splashes and inoculation injuries.  • Mobilize the community for early detection and care. • Ensure proper burial or cremation (if practiced) of dead bodies (humans and animals) 82		• Conduct community education on the disease symptoms and signs, early reporting/seeking of medical care, disease transmission and prevention, application of infection prevention and control for home care setting,  • Conduct active search for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting (older women or small children patients, for example) and provide a door to door information about prevention and when to seek care. • Ensure adequate collaboration with other sectors such as livestock, agriculture, environmental and sanitation, to ensure appropriate interventions are addressed. • Request additional help from district/regional/national levels as needed  4.1.3 Plague A zoonotic systemic bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis (plague bacillus) usually transmitted to humans by rodent fleas or by handling an infected animal.  There are 3 forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection:  • Bubonic plague is the most common, caused by the bite of an infected flea. Y. pestis, which enters the body at the bite site and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node, replicates itself and causes the lymph node to be inflamed, tense and painful, turning into open sores with pus. • Septicaemic plague occurs when infection spreads through the bloodstream, following untreated bubonic plague causing bleeding, tissue necrosis and shock. • Pharyngeal and or Pneumonic plague is the most virulent form and is rare. It is typically caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. Untreated pneumonic plague can be fatal.  Human to human transmission only occurs with the pneumonic form of plague by infectious droplets. Incubation period is 2 to 6 days and case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50-60% in untreated bubonic plague and is nearly 100% in untreated pneumonic or septicaemic plague. However, it is usually <1% with appropriate and timely treatment. Currently, plague is one of the most important reemerging bacterial zoonoses in the world.  The main risk factor is exposure to infected populations of wild or domesticated rodents and their fleas in plague endemic areas.  Case Definition Bubonic Plague Suspected case; Any person with a very painful swelling of lymph nodes – buboes And Fever (or history of fever) or at least 3 of the following: headache or chills or generalized or severe asthenia and consistent epidemiological features, such as exposure to infected animals and/or evidence of flea bites and/or residence in or travel to a known endemic area within the previous 10 days.  Confirmed case: Any person with suspected case confirmed by isolation of Yersinia pestis from blood or aspiration of buboes, or specific seroconversion or rapid diagnostic test detecting the Ag F1 in endemic areas  Pneumonic Plague Suspected case: Anyone, of any age, with coughs of less than 5 days with one of the following signs: Striated sputum from blood or dyspnea or chest pain and Fever (or history of fever) or at least 3 of the following: headache or chills or generalized or severe asthenia and Epidemiological context (contact with suspect or confirm pneumonic plague case, etc). Confirmed caseof pneumonic plague: Any suspected case of plague in which Yersinia pestis has been isolated in culture Or Suspect plague case with positive F1 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and positive PCR or Seroconversion or increase in IgG antibody titre by 4 to 15 days Suspicious death of plague: Anyone who died suddenly without apparent cause but with an epidemiological link to plague established and without biological sampling  Probable case of plague: Any suspected case of plague alive or deceased with F1 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) Or 83		Positive PCR alone  Note: Human plague remains a public health concern in Tanzania despite its quiescence in most foci for years, considering the recurrence nature of the disease. Plague hosts comprises about  50% of all the animals trapped in West Usambara Mountains in north-eastern Tanzania.  Clinical Diagnostic Criteria • Sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches • Weakness, vomiting and nausea. • Yersinia pestis is identified by laboratory testing from a sample of pus from a bubo, blood or sputum.  A specific Y. pestis antigen can be detected by different techniques.    Note:  Differential diagnosis Bubonic plague may be confused with streptococcal or staphylococcal lymphadenitis, infectious mononucleosis, cat-scratch fever, lymphatic filariasis, tick typhus, tularemia and other causes of acute lymphadenopathy  Laboratory Investigation  • Aspiration after an injection of 1-2 ml of saline through an 18-22-gauge needle. Suitable microbiological culture media (e.g. brainheart infusion, broth, sheep blood agar, or MacConkey agar) should be inoculated with a portion of each specimen.  • Smears should be examined with Wayson or Giemsa stain and with Gram=s stain to show Small gram-negative and/or bipolar-staining coccobacilli • smears should also be submitted for direct fluorescent antibody testing (anti-F1 antibody) • Serological testing - anti-F1 antigen titre by agglutination  • Molecular biological techniques based on PCR and DNA Hybridization  Note Anti-F1 rapid diagnostic test (RDT) positive alone is not a confirmed case.  Culture and PCR tests need to done at the appropriate facility.  Prevention:  • Inform people of the presence of zoonotic plague and advised to take precautions against flea bites • Do not handle animal carcasses and avoid direct contact with infected body fluids and tissues • Apply standard precautions when handling potentially infected patients and while collecting specimens  Vaccination: Not recommended except for high-risk groups (such as laboratory personnel who are constantly exposed to the risk of contamination, and health care workers).  Pharmacological Treatment A: streptomycin (IM)30 mg/kg/day (up to a total of 2 g/day) in divided doses, to be continued for 10 days of therapy or until 3 days after the temperature has returned to normal.  OR  A: erythromycin (PO) 500 mg (or 12.5 mg/kg) 8 hourly for 14 days OR  A: doxycycline (PO) 200mg 12 hourly for 14 days  Public Health Control Measures • Remove trash, food sources, and rat harborages to control rodent populations • Protect against fleas with insect repellent on skin and clothing • Conduct environmental flea control in houses, seaports and airports • Isolate patients with pneumonic plague with precautions against airborne spread until at least after 48 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy.  • Always observe the standard infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. 84		• Conduct community education on the disease symptoms and signs, early reporting/seeking of medical care, disease transmission and prevention, application of infection prevention and control for home care setting, • Mobilize community to enable rapid case detection and treatment • Provide chemoprophylaxis using tetracycline (PO) 15-30 mg/kg or chloramphenicol (PO) 30 mg/kg daily in 4 divided doses for 1 week after exposure ceases. • Ensure adequate collaboration with other sectors such as livestock, agriculture, environmental and sanitation sectors to ensure appropriate interventions are addressed.  4.1.4 Bacterial Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis Bacterial epidemics for Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis are commonly caused by Neisseria meningitidis. Other common bacteria are Haemophilus influenza, Staphylococcus aures and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people. Incubation period is 2 to 10 days. Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.

***If a neighbouring area to a population targeted for vaccination is considered to be at risk
(cases early in the dry season, no recent relevant vaccination campaign, high population
density), it should be included in a vaccination programme.
4.1.5 Neonatal Tetanus  
A neuromuscular toxin -mediated illness caused by the anaerobic spore -forming soil bacterium 
Clostridium tetani.  The disease is transmitted when spores enter open wounds (injections, cutting 
the umbilical cord) or breaks in the skin. While tetanus may occur in adults, infection primarily affects  
newborns. Neonatal  tetanus has decreased dramatically in countries with improved maternal 
tetanus immunization rates. Maternal and neonatal tetanus is targeted for elimination in the WHO 
African Region, aiming to achieve neonatal tetanus incidence rates o f less than 1 case per 1000 live 
births. Incubation period is 3 to 21 days, with an average of approximately 6 days. Usually occurs 
through introduction of tetanus spores via the umbilical cord during delivery  through the use of an 
unclean instrument to cu t the cord, or after delivery by “dressing” the umbilical stump with 
substances heavily contaminated with tetanus spores.   
Clinical Diagnostic Criteria  
• Sudden inability of a newborn to suck/feed between 2nd and 28th day after birth
• Generalized stiffness
• Convulsions
Laboratory Investigation 
• Diagnosis  is mainly clinical  as there are no reliable  laboratory  tests for confirming tetanus
• Blood counts and blood chemical findings are unremarkable.
• Peripheral leukocytosis may be suggestive
Prevention  
• Immuniz e women of reproductive age with TTCV, either during pregnancy or outside of
pregnancy. This protects the mother and also her baby through the transfer of tetanus 
antibodies to the fetus.  
• Good hygienic practices when the mother is delivering a child are al so important to
prevent neonatal and maternal tetanus.  
To be protected throughout life, WHO recommends that an individual receives 6 doses (3 
primary plus 3 booster doses) of TTCV through routine immunization.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Rigorously cle anse the umbilical stump to stop the production of toxin at the site of
infection  
Pharmacological Treatment

Frequency of drug administration should be titrated vs clinical condition  • Airway / respiratory control Provide mechanical ventilation.  • Provide adequate fluids and nutrition, as tetanus spasms result in high metabolic demands and a catabolic state.   Public Health Control Mesures The WHO global target for neonatal tetanus elimination is to reduce the incidence of neonatal tetanus to less than 1 case of neonatal tetanus (NT) per 1000 live births in every district of every country.  To meet the target • Immunize the mother and other pregnant women in the same locality as the case with at least 2 doses of tetanus toxoid. • Conduct a supplemental immunization activity for women of childbearing age in the locality. • Improve routine vaccine coverage through IVD and maternal immunization program activities. • Educate birth attendants and women of childbearing age on the need for clean cord cutting and care. Increase the number of trained birth attendants.   4.1.6 Tick-Borne Relapsing Fever (TBRF) A bacterial infection caused by bacteriaBorrelia duttonii, are known zoonoses transmitted to humans through the bite of infected “soft ticks” Ornithodoros spp that live within rodent burrows feeding on the rodent. Humans typically come into contact with soft ticks when they sleep in rodent-infested cabins.   Common Symptoms  • Recurring episodes of fever, Non-specific headache, Non-specific Muscle pain, Non-specific Joint pain, Non-specific Chills, Non-specific Vomiting, and Abdominal pain.  Bacteremia tends to be greater among pregnant women, and may sometimes result in more severe infection. Symptoms tend to develop within 7days after the tick bite. Long-term sequelae of TBRF are rare but include iritis, uveitis, cranial nerve and other neuropathies.  Clinical Diagnostic Criteria • Recurring episodes of high fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, and nausea 88		• Recurring symptoms, producing a telltale pattern of fever lasting roughly 3 days, followed by 7 days without fever, followed by another 3 days of fever. Without antibiotic treatment, this process can repeat several times.  Laboratory Investigation • Microscopy from the peripheral blood smear will reveal a long and spiral-shaped bacteriumSpirochetemia (spirochetes in blood) in TBRF patients often reaches high concentrations (>106 spirochetes/ml). Direct microscopic observation of relapsing fever spirochetes using dark field microscopy or stained peripheral blood smears  Prevention • Avoid sleeping in rodent-infested buildings whenever possible. Although rodent nests may not be visible, other evidence of rodent activity (e.g., droppings) are a sign that a building may be infested. • Prevent tick bites. Use insect repellent (on skin or clothing) or permethrin (applied to clothing or equipment).  Pharmacological Treatment A: erythromycin(PO) 500mg (or 12.5 mg/kg) 8 hourly for 14days A: tetracycline(PO)500mg 6hourly for 14days C: ceftriaxone (IV or IM) 2 grams daily for 10-14days is preferred for patients with central nervous system involvement  Public Health Control  • Provide public education, awareness, preventive control measures, and avoidance of areas where infected ticks are most abundant. • Assessing evidence of rodent activity in and around structures of infected people • Removal of rodents and their nests • Reduce tick exposures by removing tick infested structures with an appropriate pesticide applied by a professional pest control operator who is familiar with the types of “crack and crevice” treatments used to control cockroaches or other wall-dwelling pests  4.2 Viral Infections 4.2.1 Viral Haemorrhaghic Fevers (VHF) Viral Haemorrhagic Fever (VHF) is a general term for a severe illness caused by viruses and sometimes associated with bleeding. Their distribution is dependent on the ecology of reservoir hosts with a potential to cause life-threatening illness in humans. Diagnosis and management is challenging due to the non-specificity of early symptoms, limited laboratory facilities in endemic areas, severity of disease, lack of effective therapy, strict infection control requirements and propensity to cause epidemics with secondary cases in healthcare workers.  Primary transmission is from animal to human, through contact with an infected animal or its product. Secondary transmission is from person to person through: • Contact with a sick person or direct contact with the blood and/or secretions or with objects, such as needles that have been contaminated with infected secretions of an infected person. • Breast feeding • Sexual contact    Public Health Control measures  • Maintain strict viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) infection prevention and control (IPC) practicesthroughout the outbreak. • Mobilize the community for early detection and care and conduct community education about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement IPC in the home care setting and during funerals and burials. Consider social distancing strategies. • Conduct contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting. • Establish an isolation ward or treatment centre to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre and ensure strict IPC measures to avoid transmission in health care settings. 89		• Suspected cases should be isolated and treated for more common conditions with similar symptoms, which might include malaria, typhoid, louse borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Ensure a barrier is instituted between suspected and confirmed cases. • Provide psychosocial support for the family, community and staff. • Consider quarantine for high risk contacts with home support during the incubation period and ensure daily follow up of their movements. • There are promising vaccine candidates under development for some VHDs that might be useful to be used in the event of outbreak in a ring vaccination approach and for health care workers. • Treat conservatively the symptoms which might be presented; severe cases require intensive support care; if dehydrated ensure fluid replacement with fluids that contain electrolytes.  4.2.1.1 Ebola Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is a deadly disease in people and non-human primates. The viruses that cause EVD are located mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. People can get EVD through direct contact with an infected animal (bat or nonhuman primate) or a sick or dead person infected with Ebola virus. Symptoms appear from 2 to 21 days after contact with the virus, with an average of 8 to 10 days.  Case Definition:  Suspected case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine.  Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation), or epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak.  Note During an outbreak, case definitions are likely to be adapted to new clinical presentation(s) or different modes of transmission related to the local event. In outbreak setting, the following standard case definitions apply;  Suspected case: Any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: - a suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola case; - a dead or sick animal  OR • Any person with sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: - headaches - lethargy - anorexia / loss of appetite - aching muscles or joints - stomach pain - difficulty swallowing - vomiting - difficulty breathing - diarrhoea - hiccups;  • OR • Any person with inexplicable bleeding; OR • Any sudden, inexplicable death; OR • A person (alive or dead) suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: a dead or sick animal.   Clinical Diagnostic Criteria A combination of symptoms suggestive of EVD AND a possible exposure to EVD within 21 days before the onset of symptoms is suggestive of Ebola.   Symptoms • Fever • Aches and pains, such as severe headache, muscle and joint pain, and abdominal (stomach) pain • Weakness and fatigue • Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and vomiting • Abdominal (stomach) pain • Unexplained hemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising Other symptoms may include red eyes, skin rash, and hiccups (late stage) 90		  An exposure may include contact with: • Blood or body fluids from a person sick with or who died from EVD, • Objects contaminated with blood or body fluids of a person sick with or who died from EVD, • Infected fruit bats and non-human primates (apes or monkeys), or Semen from a man who has recovered from EVD.  Laboratory Investigations Ebola virus can be detected in blood after onset of symptoms. It may take up to three days after symptoms start for the virus to reach detectable levels. Investigations includes: • Blood for RT-PCR • Antigen detection or IgM (ELISA)   Note Do not take specimen before wearing appropriate PPE and ensuring the patient is in an  Isolation  Ward/ Centre   Pharmacological Treatment A: paracetamol (PO/IV) 15mg/kg 8 hourly for 3 days B: Give oxygen and manage hypoglycaemia if present  Fluid and electrolyte balance  A: compoundsodium lactate OR NS intravenously if cannot take fluids orally   B: Give Oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen status.  A: compoundsodium lactate (Ringers Lactate), NS intravenously if cannot take fluids orally. Provide IV fluids and electrolytes (body salts) through infusion into the vein (intravenously)  A: Manage hypoglycaemia with 5% DNS or 25% Dextrose Solution if hypoglycaemia is shown by RBG testing  A: Using medication to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea and to manage fever and pain. A: Treating other infections or any complicating infection and co-morbid condition A: Psychological support is given to patient and family C: Refer for Provision of Mechanical ventilation, renal dialysis, and anti-seizure therapy may be required.  Prevention • Isolate person with signs of EVD and has had a possible exposure from other people • Notify the public health authorities  • Blood samples from the patient should be collected and tested to confirm infection • Prompt identification of cases, contact tracing, and monitoring of high-risk individuals are essential to stopping Ebola virus from spreading • Early recognition of EVD is critical for infection control. However, because early symptoms are not specific to EVD, it can be hard to distinguish it from other illnesses, including malaria, leptospirosis, influenza (flu), yellow fever, dengue and other viruses spread by insects, or viral or bacterial infections of the intestines, like typhoid fever. • EVD should be considered when clinical illness is combined with an epidemiologic risk factor, like direct contact with a suspected or confirmed case or travel to an Ebola-affected area. • Once a case of EVD is identified, everyone who has come in direct contact with the sick patient is traced  • Contacts are watched for signs of illness for 21 days from the last day they came in contact with the Ebola patient. If the contact develops a fever or other EVD symptoms, they are immediately isolated, tested, and provided care.  4.2.1.2 Marburg Haemorrhagic Fevers  Marburg virus belongs to the family Filoviridae, divided into three genera: ebolaviruses, marburgviruses, and cuevaviruses. The reservoir host of Marburg virus is the African fruit 91		bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus. Fruit bats infected with Marburg virus do not to show obvious signs of illness. Primates (including humans) can become infected with Marburg virus, and may develop serious disease with high mortality. The disease can spread rapidly within the health care setting. The virus enters through broken skin, mucous membrane or exchange of bodily fluids or ingestion, inhalation and injection of infectious material  Case Definition Suspected case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine.  Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation), or epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak.  In an outbreak setting, the following standard case definitions apply;  Suspected case: Any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: - a suspected, probable or confirmed Marburg case; - a dead or sick animal  OR Any person with sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: - headaches - lethargy - anorexia / loss of appetite - aching muscles or joints - stomach pain - difficulty swallowing - vomiting - difficulty breathing - diarrhoea - hiccups; OR • Any person with inexplicable bleeding OR • Any sudden, inexplicable death; OR • A person (alive or dead) suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with a dead or sick animal   Non-Pharmacological Treatment: Supportive therapy includes:   • Mechanical ventilation, renal dialysis, and anti-seizure therapy may be required. • Management of complications symptomatically • Maintaining Oxygen status and Blood Pressure       Pharmacological Treatment There is no specific treatment for Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever.  A: paracetamol (PO/IV) 15mg/kg 8hourly for 3days B: Give oxygen and manage hypoglycaemia if present If there is Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: A: compound sodium lactate (Ringers Lactate), NS intravenously if cannot take fluids orally  B: Give Oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen status. A: sodium lactate compound (Ringers Lactate), NS intravenously if cannot take fluids orally. Provide IV fluids and electrolytes (body salts) through infusion into the vein (intravenously) A: Manage hypoglycaemia with 5% DNS or 25% Dextrose Solution if hypoglycaemia is shown by RBG testing  A: Using medication to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea and to manage fever and pain.

The virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus, one of the five genera in the family Bunyaviridae. The disease is frequently reported following heavy rainfall and floods.  RVF is mainly transmitted from animals (sheep, cattle, goats, camels) to humans through close contact with infected animals (such as handling meat and body fluids and consumption of raw milk). During established RVF outbreaks in animals, humans can also get infected through bites of infected mosquitoes and other biting insects.  92		The incubation period of RVF varies from 2 to 6 days. These symptoms usually last from 4 to 7 days. Most of the infected people recover on their own. However, a small proportion gets complications such as vomiting blood, nose bleeding and passing bloody stool. Rift Valley fever is difficult to distinguish from other viral haemorrhagic fevers as well as many other diseases that cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, and yellow fever.  Case Definitions Suspected case: Early Disease:  Acute febrile illness (axillary temperature >37.5 ºC or oral temperature of >38.0ºC) of more than 48 hours’ duration that does not respond to antibiotic or antimalarial therapy, and is associated with: • Direct contact with sick or dead animal or its products AND / OR • Recent travel (during last week) to, or living in an area where, after heavy rains, livestock die or abort, and where RVF virus activity is suspected/confirmed AND / OR • Abrupt onset of any 1 or more of the following: exhaustion, backache, muscle pains, headache (often severe), discomfort when exposed to light, and nausea/vomiting AND / OR: • Nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea OR abdominal pain with 1 or more of the following:  • Severe pallor (or Hb < 8 gm/dL) • Low platelets (thrombocytopenia) as evidence by presence of small skin and mucous membrane haemorrhages (petechiae) (or platelet count < 100x109 / d • Evidence of kidney failure (edema, reduced urine output) (or creatinine > 150 mol/L) AND / OR • Evidence of bleeding into skin, bleeding from puncture wounds, from mucous membranes or nosefrom gastrointestinal tract and unnatural bleeding from vagina AND / OR • Clinical jaundice (3-fold increase above normal of transaminases)  Late stages of diseases or complications (2-3 weeks after onset) • Patients who have experienced, in the preceding month a flu-like illness, with clinical criteria, who additionally develop the following: o CNS manifestations which resemble meningo-encephalitis AND/OR: o Unexplained visual loss OR o Unexplained death following sudden onset of acute flu-like illness with haemorrhage, meningo-ecephalitis, or visual loss during the preceding month. Confirmed case: Any patient who, after clinical screening, is positive for anti-RVF IgM ELISA antibodies (typically appear from fourth to sixth day after onset of symptoms) or tests positive on reverse transcriptase polymerase chainreaction (RT-PCR).  Transmission to human is mainly through direct or indirect contact with blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be transmitted to human through; • Handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures.  • Inoculation e.g via wound from infected knife or through contact with broken skin or through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of an infected animals.  • Infected mosquito. Human become viraemic; capable of infecting mosquitoes shortly before onset of fever and for the first 3–5 days of illness. Once infected, mosquitoes remain so for life.  Clinical Diagnostic Criteria • Acute febrile illness that does notrespond to antibiotic or antimalarial therapy,  • Exhaustion, backache, muscle pains, headache (often severe),  • Photophobia • Nausea/vomiting • Evidence of bleeding into skin, bleeding from puncture wounds, from mucous membranes or nose, from gastrointestinal tract and unnatural bleeding from vagina 93		• Clinical jaundice (3-fold increase above normal of transaminases) Clinical diagnosis is difficult, because RVF symptoms can be mild and non-specific, especially early in the course of the disease.   Laboratory Investigations Definitive diagnosis of RVF involves laboratory testing of blood (during illness) or other tissue samples (postmortem tissue).  • The virus detection in the blood then virus isolation in cell culture  • Molecular techniques (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR). • Antibody testing using Enzyme-Linked ImmunoAssay (ELISA) confirms infection with RVFV  • IgM antibodies reflect a recent infection and IgG antibodies persist for several years (Detection of anti-RVF IgM suggests an ongoing transmission of RVFV in humans during inter-epidemic periods.).  • FBC  o Low Hb [Hb<8gm/dL - Severe pallor o Low platelet < 100 x109 /Dl (Thrombocytopenia) – small skin and mucous membrane hemorrhages (Petechiae))   • Serum Creatinine   Note Acute RVF can be diagnosed using several different methods 1. Serological tests such as ELISA may confirm the presence of specific IgM antibodies to the virus. The virus itself may be detected in blood during the early phase of illness or in post-mortem tissue using a variety of techniques including, antigen detection tests by ELISA, RT-PCR, virus propagation (in cell cultures), Immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed tissues 2. ELISA IgG can be used for retrospective diagnostic.   Management  Management of RVF in humans is mainly supportive as there is no definitive treatment for RVF. Early detection and management of the disease is important. Human control of RVF is through control of the disease in animals through a sustained vaccination program and limiting human-animal contact. Use of insecticide treated nets and mosquito repellents can also reduce infections in human. In addition to human suffering and death, RVF has far reaching economic implications to the Livestock industry. In outbreak settings, the disease manifestation includes non-haemorrhagic febrile syndromes, and laboratory testing should be considered among persons with milder symptoms suggestive of viral illness.  Prevention People living in or visiting areas with RVF shall be protected from the RVF infection with these steps: • Protect people from contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. (Use PPEs like gloves, boots, long sleeves, and a face shield)  • Protect people from unsafe animal products. All animal products (including meat, milk, and blood) should be thoroughly cooked before eating or drinking. • Protect people from mosquitoes and other bloodsucking insects. Use insect repellents and bed nets, and wear long sleeved shirts and long pants to cover exposed skin.  No vaccines are currently available for vaccination in people at risk of RVF infection.  Public Health Control Measures • Mobilize the community for early detection and care. • Conduct community education about the confirmed case, how the disease is transmitted, and how to prevent contact with tissues of infected animals and avoid mosquito bites. • Provide information about prevention in the home and when to seek care. • Provide supportive treatment to all cases identified • Collaborate with the animal health specialists to search and document cases among animals as well.  94		4.2.1.4 Yellow Fever Yellow fever virus is an RNA that belongs to the genus Flavivirus and is related to West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis viruses.  It is transmitted human-to-human via the domestic species of Aedes mosquitoes (Urban epidemics) or to humans from primate reservoir via a forest mosquito species (Sylvatic cycle). About 15% of infections progress to fever and jaundice. While only the minority of cases are severe, case fatality rate may be 25% to 50% among patients with syndrome of haemorrhage, jaundice, and renal disease. A small proportion of patients develop “toxic phase” with jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes, hence the name ‘yellow fever’), dark urine and abdominal pain with vomiting. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach and half of those die within 7 to 10 days.  Risk factor: Sporadic cases often linked to occupation or village location near woods or where monkeys are numerous, also non-vaccinated persons. Infection and disease can be prevented by vaccination. With a vaccine efficacy > 95% and duration of immunity is life time  Case definition Suspected case: Any person with acute onset of fever, with jaundice appearing within 14 days of onset of the first symptoms.  Probable case: A suspected case with one of the following; • Epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak • Positive post-mortem liver histopathology  Confirmed case: A probable case with one of the following; • Detection of YF-specific* IgM • Detection of four-fold increase in YF IgM and/or IgG antibody titres between acute and convalescent serum samples • Detection of YFV-specific* neutralizing antibodies  *YF-specific means that antibody tests (such as IgM or neutralizing antibody) for other prevalent flavivirus are negative. This testing should include at least IgM for Dengue and West Nile and may include other flavivirus depending on local epidemiology.  OR One of the following • Detection of YF virus genome in blood or other organs by PCR Detection of yellow fever antigen in blood, liver or other organs by immunoassays Isolation of the yellow fever virus  Laboratory Investigations • ELISA for the presence of yellow fever Specific IgM and IgG antibodies. • Exclusion of Dengue, West Nile virus and other locally prevalent flavivirus will be necessary for the confirmation of yellow fever. • PCR, YF specific seroneutralization, virus isolation or histopathology  Management  Non-Pharmacological Treatment No specific anti-viral treatment, supportive therapies are recommended. Good and early supportive treatment for dehydration, liver and kidney failure, and fever improves outcomes. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics  Prevention Prevention and Control involve mosquito control and provision of Yellow Fever vaccine. The yellow fever vaccine is safe, affordable and a single dose provides life-long protection against yellow fever disease.  Indication of Yellow Fever Vaccination • Persons ≥ 9 months of age • Planning travel to or residence in an endemic area • Planning travel to a country with an entry requirement Needs to be given ≥ 10 days prior to arrival in endemic area  95		Contraindications of Yellow Fever Vaccination  • Infants aged less than 9 months; • Pregnant women – except during a yellow fever outbreak when the risk of infection is high; • People with severe allergies to egg protein; and People with severe immunodeficiency due to symptomatic HIV/AIDS or other causes, or who have a thymus disorder  Public Health Control Measures • Identify all cases and provide clinical, epidemiological and laboratory evidences  • Identify contacts, screen and test for confirmation • Educate the communities affected on mosquito control  • Destroy known sources of standing water and any newly discovered sites for the presence of mosquito larvae. • Surveillance of Mosquito by Mosquito control professionals  4.2.1.5 Dengue Fever Dengue virus is an arbovirus transmitted by aedes mosquitoes (both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus). Dengue fever is caused by four serologically distinct, but closely related Dengue viruses: dengue virus (DENV) 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Flaviviridae family. Dengue fever is an emerging pandemic that has spread globally during the past 30 years as a result of changes in human ecology. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a potentially deadly complication that has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in Asia and Africa. There is good evidence that sequential infection with the different serotypes of dengue virus increases the risk of more severe disease that can result in dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death.   Infected humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving a source of the virus for uninfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which maintain the urban dengue transmission cycle. The virus circulates in the blood of infected human for 2-7 days, at approximately the same time that they have a fever. A sylvatic transmission cycle has been documented in West Africa where DENV-2 has been found in monkeys. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission.  DENV is frequently transported from one place to another by infected travelers; when susceptible vectors are present in these new areas, there is the potential for local transmission to be established.  Case Definition Dengue Fever Suspected case: Any person with acute febrile illness of 2-7 days duration with 2 or more of the following: headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, leucopenia.  Dengue Fever Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, four-fold or greater rise in IgG antibody titres, positive PCR or viral isolation).  Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever: A probable or confirmed case of dengue with bleeding tendencies as evidenced by one or more of the following: positive tourniquet test; petechieae, ecchymoses or purpura; bleeding: mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites or other; haematemesis or melaena; and thrombocytopenia (100,000 cells or less per mm3) and evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability, manifested by one or more of the following: 20% rise in average haematocrit for age and sex, 20% drop in haematocrit following volume replacement therapy compared to baseline, signs of plasma leakage (pleural effusion, ascites, hypo-proteinaemia).  Dengue Shock Syndrome: All the above criteria, plus evidence of circulatory failure manifested by rapid and weak pulse, and narrow pulse pressure (≤ 20 mm Hg) or hypotension for age, cold, clammy skin and altered mental status.  Laboratory Investigations • Reverse Transcriptase–Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT–PCR) • Rapid Tests for Dengue NSI antigen Serological methods, such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) for IgM and IgG anti-dengue antibodiesFBP 96		  Management  There is no specific treatment for dengue, but appropriate medical care frequently saves the lives of patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever.  Non-Pharmacological Treatment No specific treatment is available for Dengue fever.   Pharmacological Treatment:  A:  paracetamol (PO/IV) 15mg/kg 8hourly for 3days A: Maintainance fluid (Ringers lactate, NS) intravenously if one cannot take enough fluid orally  B: Blood transfusion and clotting factors. B: Oxygen and manage hypoglycaemia if present  Note • No antibiotics are of proven value.  • Children below 12 years require close monitoring for dangerous form.  • Steroids should not be used. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided. These anti-inflammatory drugs act by thinning the blood, and in a disease with risk of hemorrhage, blood thinners may exacerbate the prognosis  Prevention At present, the only method of controlling or preventing dengue virus transmission is to combat the vector mosquitoes using environmental management and chemical methods. • Prevent dengue by avoiding mosquito bites by Aedes. aegypti and Aedes. albopictus bite during the day and night (Using mosquito repellant, bed nets and removing reservoirs). • All four dengue viruses are spread primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. • A dengue vaccine is available for use in some parts of the world  Public Health Control Measures • Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbs • Use mosquito repellents • Use mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. Effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoes  4.2.1.6 Chikungunya Fever Chikungunya Virus Disease is the arthropod-borne virus caused by Chikungunya Virus (CHIKV), transmitted by the Aedes aegyptiand Aedes albopictus mosquitos the same which transmit Dengue virus, West Nile and Yellow Fever viruses. Chikungunya disease (Seroprevalance 7.7% to 26.9% in Tanzania) does not often result in death, but the symptoms can be severe and disabling. People at risk for more severe disease include newborns, older adults (≥65 years), and people with medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. The word "Chikungunya" is Makonde for "that which bends up," in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.  Case Definition Acute clinical case • Clinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint paina (usually incapacitatingb) with acute onseta AND • Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance) b OR • Laboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance) 97		 • Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age group). • In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking  Atypical case Clinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.  Severe acute case Clinical case of laboratory-confirmed Chikungunyapresenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalization  Suspected and confirmed chronic cases Suspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently. Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test  Laboratory Investigations Chikungunya is a biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) • Detection of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) viral culture of blood in the first 3 days • RT-PCR for Viral RNA from the serum collected <6 days after onset of illness. Serological tests show a four-fold rise in antibody titer to Chikungunya virus;  Non-Pharmacological Treatment: The mainstay treatment for Chikungunya is the supportive symptomatic treatment.  A: Assure plenty of rest to patients  Pharmacological Treatment A: Maintain body fluids Sodium Lactate Compound (Ringers Lactate) intravenously. A: Control Fever and Pain by giving paracetamol (PO/IV]15mg/kg 8hourly for 3days  Note • No antibiotics are of proven value.  • Steroids should not be used. • Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided. These anti-inflammatory drugs act by thinning the blood, and in a disease with risk of hemorrhage, blood thinners may exacerbate the prognosis • Do not use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para-menthane-diol (PMD) on children under 3 years old. • Do not apply insect repellent to a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, cuts, or irritated skin   Prevention  The most effective way to prevent infection from Chikungunya virus is to prevent mosquito bites during the day and night.  • Use insect repellent (DEET, Picaridin (known as KBR 3023 and icaridin IR3535, Oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), Para-menthane-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone) • Modification of the mosquito bleeding sites • Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants,  • Treat clothing and gears with permethrin • Take steps to control mosquitoes indoors and outdoors  Public Health Control Measures • Symptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices. Persistent joint pain may require analgesic and long- term anti-inflammatory therapy. • Prevention is entirely dependent upon taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites. 98		• To avoid mosquito bites: o Wear full sleeve clothes and long dresses to cover the limbs o Use mosquito repellents o Use mosquito nets – to protect babies, old people and others, who may rest during the day. o The effectiveness of such nets can be improved by treating them with permethrin (pyrethroid insecticide). Curtains (cloth or bamboo) can also be treated with insecticide and hung at windows or doorways, to repel or kill mosquitoes  4.2.2 Measles (Rubeola) Measles is an acute, highly communicable (contagious) infectious viral disease caused by Measles virus (MeV) which is the member of the family Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus. The mode of transmission is airborne, by droplet spread through coughing or sneezing, or by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected persons. It is the fourth leading cause of death in children less than 5 years of age in many African countries.  Case Definition Suspected case: Any person with fever and maculopapular (non-vesicular) generalized rash and cough, coryza or conjunctivitis (red eyes) or any person in whom a clinician suspects measles. Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody) or epidemiological link to confirmed cases in an outbreak.  Clinical Diagnostic Criteria • Generalized, reddish (erythematous), blotchy (maculopapular) rash;  • History of fever usually above 38˚C (if not measured, then "hot" to touch); • Dry cough; Sore throat; Runny nose (coryza); • Inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis), tiny white spots with bluish-white centers on a red background found inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek- also called Koplik's spots.  • In addition, children with measles frequently exhibit a dislike of bright light (photophobia), and often have a sore red mouth (stomatitis). Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days  Laboratory Investigation With coordination from the WHO, the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN) performs case-based laboratory surveillance standardized methods to confirm Measles Infection by  • Detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR (increasing role in case confirmation),  • Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) for immunoglobulin M (IgM)   Pharmacological Treatment Note No specific antiviral treatment exists for measles virus   Adults:  A: paracetamol(PO) 1g 8hourly for 5days AND A: vitamin A (PO) 200000 IU stat  In case of ocular involvement, add  A: oxytetracycline eye ointment 1% apply once daily for 7 days   Children: A: paracetamol (PO) 10–15mg/kg 8hourly for 5days  A: vitamin A if less than 1 year give 100,000IU (PO) start and if over 1 year give 200,000IU    Prevention Routine measles vaccination for children combined with mass immunization campaigns  • Administration of the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) at 9 months and 18 months in measles-endemic regions (Tanzania) and at 12–15 months in non-endemic regions. 99		• Accelerated immunization activities have had a major impact on reducing measles deaths. • The World Health Organization (WHO) defines measles elimination as “the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a defined geographical area (e.g. region or country) for at least 12 months in the presence of a surveillance system that has been verified to be performing well.  Public Health Control Measures Efforts to reduce the secondary spread of measles include; • Improve routine vaccine coverage through the IVD, and lead supplemental vaccination activities in areas of low vaccine coverage. • Mobilize the community early to enable rapid case detection and treatment. • Provide Vitamin A: Dose 1: immediately, Dose 2: next day  4.2.3 Rabies Rabies is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by a virus. Rabies infects domestic and wild animals, and is spread to people through close contact with infected saliva (via bites or scratches) The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and, eventually, death. Early symptoms in people include: fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease progresses, symptoms include; insomnia, anxiety, confusion, slight or partialparalysis, excitable behaviour, hallucinations, increase in saliva, difficulty swallowing, and fear of water (hydrophobia).  In unvaccinated humans, rabies is almost always fatal if post-exposure prophylaxis is not administered before the onset of severe symptoms. Death usually occurs within days of the onset of neurological symptoms. Dogs are the main carrier of rabies in Africa and are responsible for most (approximately 97%) of the human rabies deaths worldwide WHO estimates approximately 55,000 human deaths worldwide due to rabies each year; in Africa the annual death toll is 24,000.  Case Definition Suspected: A person with one or more of the following: headache, neck pain, nausea, fever, fear of water, anxiety, agitation, abnormal tingling sensations or pain at the wound site, when contact with a rabid animal is suspected. Confirmed: A suspected case that is laboratory confirmed  Laboratory Investigation  Human rabies is confirmed by intra-vitam and post mortem diagnostic techniques that detect whole viruses, viral antigens, or nucleic acids in infected tissues (brain, skin or saliva). E.g. Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, which targets rabies virus antigens in brain tissue, Identification of viral nucleic acid by reverse transcriptase PCR on fixed tissue collected post mortem or in a clinical specimen (brain tissue or skin, cornea or saliva) or Detectable rabies-neutralizing antibody titre in the CSF of an unvaccinated person.  Pharmacological Treatment Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the immediate treatment of a bite victim after rabies exposure by • Extensive washing and local treatment of the bite wound or scratch as soon as possible after a suspected exposure; • Providing effective rabies vaccine that meets WHO standards • Administration of rabies immunoglobulin (RIG), if indicated.  Local wound therapy: -wash wound thoroughly with running water and soap for 10 minutes, and repeat process with:   A: 10% Povidone iodine; to prevent secondary bacterial infection. If patient present with Anxiety, Agitation, Seizures,  A: diazepam Adults 10mg IV slowly in 3–5minutes (0.1–0.3 mg/kg in 3–5 min) 10mg in 3–5minutes, repeated 1–4 hourly Paediatrics 0.1–0.3 mg/kg in 3–5min, repeated 1–4 hourly to provide (total 2.4–12 mg/kg IV for 24 h)                  OR  A:diazepam (IV) slowly in 3–5minutes, repeated 1–4hourly for 24hours 100		                 OR A:  diazepam (IM) 20mg 2hourly for 24hours                 OR A:  diazepam (Intrarectally) 10mg 1–4 hourly for 24 hours OR A: lorazepam 25–50mcg/kg 6 hourly for 24 hours  OR C: midazolam 0.08 – 0.2mg/kg (IV) repeated 1–4 hourly for 24 to 48 hours               OR C: midazolam (intrarectally)10–30mg over 24 hours by pump for 24 to 48 hours   If patient present with Anxiety A: Haloperidol 5mg (IM or SC) hourly until calm, then 4 or 6 hourly and when necessary             OR A: haloperidol 5 mg (IV) 5–15mg/24 hours OR  A: chlorpromazine (IM) 25–50mg/6–8 hourly for 48hours  Table 4.3: Support for Patient with Fever, Hypersecretion and Pain Indication Drug Route of administration Dose: adult Dose: paediatric Fever A: paracetamol iv infusion over 15 minutes 1 g every 8 h, maximum 3-4 g/24 h  intrarectal 1g every 4–6h, maximum 3-4  g/24 h 10–15mg/kg (PO)  every 8 hours for 5 days A: ibuprofen intrarectal 300–400 mg 8 hourly  A: aspirin intrarectal 450–900mg 4hourly, maximum 3.6 g/day  Hypersecretion A: Hyoscine (scopolamine) hydrobromide sc or iv injection 400 mcg 4 hourly 10 mcg/kg 4–8hourly sc infusion 1.2–2 mg/24 h 40–60 mcg/kg/24h Pain C: morphine slow iv, sc or im 10 mg 4hourly  intrarectal 15–30 mg 4hourly 100 mcg/kg S: fentanyl transdermal patch 12–25 mcg/h every 72 h 12 mcg/h every 72h  Prevention • Rabies can be prevented by  • Vaccinating pets • Staying away from wildlife • Seeking medical care after potential exposures before symptoms start • Immunization   Immunization  Active Immunization  Pre-exposure immunization is recommended for people in certain high-risk occupations such as laboratory workers handling live rabies and rabies-related (lyssavirus) viruses; and people (such as animal disease control staff and wildlife rangers)  Active immunization: Human Diploid Cell Vaccine (HDCV) –either ID or IM  A: anti-rabies Vaccines (2- 3 IU/dose)  o IM: 1ml on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28 (5 doses)  101		o ID: 0.2ml by dividing 0.1 ml on left shoulder and 0.1ml on right shoulder, on days 0, 3, 7 and 28 (4 doses). Intradermal (ID) is mostly advised. In addition, patients should receive rabies immune globulin with the 1st dose (day 0)  Passive Immunization  B: anti-rabies human immunoglobulin 20 IU/kg half the dose given parenterally and the other half injected into and around the wound for victims suspected to be infected   AND A: tetanus toxoid vaccine, please refer to the section on Tetanus  Note Treat the person immediately after the animal bite, before onset of symptoms    Corticosteroid therapy generally is not considered for the management of brain edema in rabies.  Public Health Control Measures • Post exposure prophylaxis to prevent rabies • Isolate patient and immunize contacts to prevent infection of others • Vaccinate local dogs and cats to prevent outbreaks • Promote public awareness of rabies • Target immunization campaign for domestic or wild animals in high-risk areas • Maintain active surveillance of rabies in animals  4.2.4   Zika Virus Disease Zika virus is a flavivirus that is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily Aedes aegypti, and also Aedes albopictus, the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Zika virus can also be transmitted in-utero from mother to fetus, and through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation. Zika virus infections are usually asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they tend to be mild and include mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and muscle and joint pain that last for 2 to 7 days. There is no specific treatment but symptoms can be treated with common fever medicines, rest and drinking fluids.  Zika virus infection during pregnancy can result in preterm birth, fetal loss, stillbirth, and congenital malformations including microcephaly, limb contractures, eye abnormalities, brain calcifications, and other manifestations of Congenital Zika Syndrome. Zika virus is also associated with an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neurological complications requiring close medical management and possibly intensive care and mechanical ventilation.  Case Definition Suspected Case: Any person presenting with rash and/or fever and at least one of the following signs or symptoms: • arthralgia; or • arthritis; or • conjunctivitis (non-purulent/hyperaemic).  Probable case: A suspected case with presence of IgM antibody against Zika virus and an epidemiological link (with no evidence of infection with other flaviviruses).  Confirmed case: Any person with laboratory confirmation of recent Zika virus infection presence of Zika virus RNA or antigen in serum or other samples (e.g. saliva, urine, tissue, whole blood); or IgM antibody against Zika virus positive and Plague Reduction Neutralizing Test (PRNT90) for Zika virus with titre ≥20 and Zika virus PRNT90 titre ratio ≥ 4 compared to other flaviviruses; and exclusion of other flaviviruses.  Clinical Diagnostic Criteria: • Fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis,  • Joint pain, malaise, Headache - usually mild and last for 2–7 days.  • Neurological and auto-immune complications of Zika virus disease, babies born with microcephaly (Observed in northeast Brazil).    102	Laboratory Investigations  
•Reverse transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR) for viral RNA
•Serology for IgM detection
•Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)
Non-Pharmacological Treatment:  
The mainstay treatment for Zika Virus is the supportive symptomatic treatment. 
• A: Assure  plenty of rest to patients
Pharmacolog ical Treatment  
• A: Maintain body fluids Sodium Lactate Compound (Ringers Lactate) intravenously.
• A: Control Fever and Pain by giving Acetaminophen or Paracetamol 15mg/kg (PO/IV) 8
hourly for 3 days 
Note  
• No antibiotics are of proven value.
• Steroids should not be used.
• Non-Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be
avoided. These anti -inflammatory drugs act by thinning the blood, and in a disease with
risk of hemorrhage, blood thinners may exacerbate the prognosis
• Do n ot use products containing oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE) or para -menthane -diol
(PMD) on children under 3 years old.
• Do not apply insect repellent to a child’s hands, eyes, mouth, cuts, or irritated skin
Prevention 
•Vector control: - removal and modificat ion of breeding sites and reducing contact between
mosquitoes and people
•Wearing clothing (preferably light- coloured) that covers as much of the body as possible;
• Using physical barriers such as window screens and closed doors and windows;
•Applying inse ct repellent to skin or clothing that contains DEET, IR3535 or icaridin
Public Health Control Measures  
•Strengthen event -based surveillance to detect the emergence of clusters of cases
presenting with rash and febrile syndrome of unknown aetiology.
•Activel y engage other sectors (e.g., environment, agriculture, tourism) to respond to Zi ka
virus through a multi -sectoral approach (One Health approach).
•Enhance surveillance of Zika virus disease and of the conditions that may be associated
with it, including mi crocephaly and congenital Zika syndrome and Guillain -Barré syndrome
(GBS).
•Enhance surveillance at prenatal and postnatal clinics to monitor possible congenital
infections and complications.
•Conduct community -based assessments to determine the abundance of  vector
mosquitoes, identify the most productive larval habitats, promote and implement plans for
appropriate vector control.
• Report any identified unusual increase in the incidence of congenital neurological
malformations including microcephaly in neonate s and adverse pregnancy outcomes not
explained through alternate causes, to the relevant public health authorities using IDSR
framework.
•Intensify of efforts to reduce mosquito populations including elimination of potentia l
breeding sites (e.g., removal of  trash and standing water sites around homes, covering
home water storage containers, and use of larvicides) and adult mosquito control methods.
•Promotion of personal protection measures such as use of light -coloured protective
clothing (long sleeves and p ants), insect repellent, and physical barriers such as screens,
closed doors and windows, and sleeping under mosquito nets including during the da y
when Aedes mosquitoes are most active.
•Develop risk communication messages to address population concerns, e nhanc e
community engagement, improve reporting, and ensure application of vector control and
personal protective measures targeting reduction of contact with the vector.103	•Provide women of childbearing age and particularly pregnant women with the necessary
information and materials on family planning and to reducing risk of exposure.
•Provide clinical and psychosocial support services for affected children and families.
•Zika can be transmitted through blood and blood products. Precautions already in place for
ensuring safe blood donations, transfusions, and prevention of bloodborne pathogens
should be followed.
•Zika can be transmitted sexually. Men and women need to get counselling on safer sexual
practices, and be offered condoms and full range of contraceptiv e methods.
•Ensure that pregnant women who have been exposed to Zika virus be counselled and
followed for birth outcomes based on the best available information and national practice
and policies.
•Refer most severe cases with complication to hospitalized ca res.
4.2.5 COVID -19 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) is a recently discovered disease, caused by a Coronavirus, 
named SARS -CoV-2, which is genetically related to the virus causing Severe Acute Respiratory 
Syndrome (SARS) of 2003 and Middle East Respira tory Syndrome (MERS). This virus belongs to 
the family  Coronaviridae , of the order  Nidovirales suspected to originate from an animal host 
(zoonotic origin) followed by human -to-human transmission. The disease was first detected in 
Wuhan, the capital city of  Hubei, China, in December of 2019 and declared by the WHO to be a 
Public Health Emergency of International Concern, in 11 March 2020 due to its evident rapid 
disease spread worldwide in less than 6  months. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID -
19 range from 1 -14 days, most commonly around five days.  
Current evidence suggests that COVID -19 spreads between people through direct, indirect (through 
contaminated objects or surfaces), or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose 
secretions (saliva, respiratory secretions or secretion droplets). 
People with the virus in their noses and throats may leave infected droplets on objects and surfaces 
(called fomites) when they sneeze, cough on, or touch surfaces, such as tables, doorknobs and 
handrails. Other people may become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching 
their eyes, noses or mouths before cleaning their hands.  
Case definition  
The case definitions are based on the current information available and might be re vised as new 
information accumulates.  
Suspect case: A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of 
respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting co mmunity transmission of COVID -19 disease during the 14 days prior to 
symptom onset.  
OR 
A patient with any acute respiratory illness AND having been in contact with a confirmed or probable 
COVID -19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to symptom onset;  
OR 
A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/symptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that fully exp lains the clinical presentation.  
Probable case: Any suspect case for whom testing for COVID -19 is inconclusive or is tested positive 
using a pancoronavirus assay and without laboratory evidence of other respiratory pathogens.  
OR 
A suspect case for whom tes ting could not be performed for any reason  
OR 
Any suspect case or death with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak  
OR 
Any suspect case with typical appearance of COVID -19 in Chest Computed Tomography (CT) or 
chest x- rays.  
Confirmed case: An in dividual (contact or suspect case) with a laboratory- confirmed COVID -19 by 
real-time reverse -transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT -PCR).  104	OR 
A suspect case with a strong epidemiological link to COVID- 19 patient and detection of antigen 
using validated/adequate direct SARS -CoV-2 antigen detection tests.  
OR 
A suspect case with a strong epidemiological link to COVID -19 patient and detection of exposure to 
virus (Antibodies – IgM and/or IgG, IgA) using validated/adequate serology tests (indirect antibody 
detection tests).  
Clinical Diagnosis  
Most common symptoms:  
• Fever, Dry Cough and Tiredness
Less common symptoms:  
Headache, Sore throat , Loss of taste or smell, Chills, Runny nose, Headache, Chest pain , 
Muscle aches, Diarrhea,, Conjunctivitis, Skin rash , or Discoloration of fingers or toes  
Serious symptoms - Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI):  
• Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
• Chest pain or pressure
• Loss of speech or movement
The risk of serious illness from COVID -19 includes serious hear t diseases, such as heart failure, 
coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy, Cancer, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), Type 2 diabetes, Type 1 diabetes, Asthma, Liver Disease, Cystic Fibrosis, Severe obesity, 
Chronic kidney disease, Sickle cel l disease, Immunocompromized patients by solid organ 
transplants, bone marrow transplant, HIV or cancer medications. 
Laboratory Investigation  
Rule out Community -Acquired Pneumonia ( Streptococcus pneumonia , Haemophilus influenza  type 
b, Staphylococcus aure aus, Klebsiella pneumoniae , Legionella pneumophila , Influenza viruses, and 
Respiratory Syncytial virus).  
Specimen collection, processing, and laboratory testing shall follow biosafety procedures.  
• Collect blood cultures for bacteria that cause pneumoni a and s epsis, ideally beforeantimicrobial
therapy.
• DO NOT delay antimicrobial therapy while waiting for b lood culture results.
• Collect specimens from BOTH the upper respiratory tract (URT; nasopharyngealand
orophar yngeal
) AND lower respiratory tract (LRT; expectorated sputum, endotracheal  aspirate, or
Broncho alveolar lavage) for SARS- CoV-2testing by RT -PCR.
Clinicians may elect to collect only LRT samples when these are readily available ( for example, in
mechanically ventilated patients).
• Use appropr iate PPE for specimen collection (droplet and contact precautions forURT specimens;
airborne precautions for LRT specimens).• When collecting URT samples, use viral swabs (sterile Dacron or Rayon, not cott
 on) and viral
transport media.
Where feasible both URT and LRT specimens can be tested for other respiratory viruses 
like Influenza A and B (including zoonotic influenza A), Respiratory syncytial virus, 
Parainfluenzaviruses, Rhinoviruses, Adenoviruses, Enteroviruses (e.g. EVD68), Human meta 
pneumovirus, and Endemic human coronaviruses (i.e. HKU1, OC43, NL63, and 229E). Note  
Do not take s ample from the nostrils or tonsils  105	• Routine confirmation of cases of COVID- 19 is based on detection of unique sequences of
virus RNA by Nucleic acid amplifica tion tests (NAAT) such as real -time reverse -
transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT -PCR).
• Serological testing (indirect antibody detection tests) can aid investigation of an ongoing
outbreak and retrospective assessment of the attack rate or extent o f an outbreak.
• Viral sequencing to providing confirmation of the presence of the virus, regularsequencing of a percentage of specimens from clinical cases can be useful to monitor for
viral genome mutations
• Viral culture is not recommended as a routine diagnostic procedure.
Severity of Illness Categories  
•Asymptomatic or Pre- Symptomatic Infection: Individuals who test positive for SARS -CoV-2 using a
virologic test (i.e., a nucleic acid amplification test or an antigen test), but who have no symptoms
that are consistent with COVID -19.
• Mild Illness: Individuals who have any of the various signs and symptoms of COVID -19 (e.g., fever,
cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste and
smell) but who do not have  shortness of breath, dyspnea, or abnormal chest imaging.
• Moderate Illness: Individuals who show evidence of lower respiratory disease during clinicalassessment or imaging and who have saturation of oxygen (SpO2) ≥94% on room air at sea level.
• Severe Illness: Individuals who have SpO2 <94% on room air at sea level, a ratio of arterial partial
pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2 /FiO2) <300 mmHg, respiratory frequency
>30 breaths per minute, or lung infiltrates >50%.
• Critical Illne ss: Individuals who have respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ
dysfunction.
Management 
• All patients with suspected COVID- 19 who have severe acute respiratory infection should
be triaged and isolated at the first point of contact with the health care system. 
• Emergency treatment should be started based on disease severity.
• For those presenting with mild illness, hospitalization may not be required unless there is
concern about rapid deterioration. If there is only mild illness, providin g care at home may 
be considered if available. 
• Moderate to severe and critical cases must be admitted for management.
• Admitted cases must be monitored for early identification of deterioration and appropriate
treatment offered as per national treatment p rotocol for moderate to severe COVID -19 
patients. 
• Oxygen is the mainstay of therapy for those whose SpO2 drops according the guideline.
• Recovered patients may be discharged if 2 RT -PCR taken at least 24 hours apart are
negative with clinical recovery (te mperature resolved for more than 48 hours and no need 
for oxygen therapy). 
Note  
• All areas for treatment of COVID -19 patients should be equipped with pulse oximeters, functioning
oxygen systems and disposable, single -use, oxygen -delivering interfaces (nasal cannula, simple
face mask, and mask with reservoir
bag).
• Use contact precautions when handling contaminated oxygen interfaces of patients with SARS-
CoV-2 infection.
Early General Supportive Therapy and Monitoring  
Patients with SARI shall be manage d in isolated critical care units  
• Give supplemental oxygen therapy  immediately to patients with SARI and respiratory
distress, hypoxemia, or shock.
o Initiate oxygen therapy at 5 L/min and titrate flow rates to reach target SpO 2≥90%
in non -pregnant adults and SpO 2≥92-95 % in pregnant patients.
o Children with emergency signs (obstructed or absent breathing, severe

• Do not routinely give systemic corticosteroids for treatment of viral pneumonia.
(No survival  benefit and possible harms (avascular necrosis, psychosis, diabetes, and
delayed viral clearance).
• co
rticosteroid should be used with caution in the treatment of COVID -19 patients < 7 days:
corticosteroids are not recommended for patients with mild condit ions
Focused Supportive Management  
Infection Control:  
•For health care workers who are performing aerosol -gener ating procedures on patients
with COVID- 19, Using an N95 respirator (or equivalent or higher -level respirator) rather
than surgical masks, in  addition to other personal protective equipment (i.e., gloves, gown,
and eye protection such as a face shield or safety goggles)
•Endotracheal intubation in patients with COVID -19 to be performed by health care
providers with extensive airway management  exper ience, if possible
•Intubation be performed using video laryngoscopy, if possible
He
modynamic Support:  
•Norepinephrine as the first -ch oice vasopressor
•For adults with COVID -19 and refractory septic shock who are not receiving corticosteroids
to treat their COVID -19, 
Low-dose corticosteroid therapy (“shock -reversal”) over no corticosteroid therapy 
Ventilatory Support:  
•For adults with COVID -19 and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure despite conventional
oxygen therapy, high -flow nasal cannul a (HFNC) oxygen over noninvasive positi ve
pressure ventilation (NIPPV) (BI).
•For patients with persistent hypoxemia despite increasing supplemental oxygen
requirements in whom endotracheal  
in
tubation is not otherwise indicated, considering a trial of aw ake prone positioning to 
improve oxygenation  
•For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID -19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), use low tidal volume (VT) ventilation (VT 4– 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight)
over higher tidal volumes (VT >8 mL/kg)
•For mechanically ventilated adults with COVID -19 and refractory hypoxemia despite
optimized ventilation, prone ventilation for 12 to 16 hours per day over no prone ventilation107	Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Replacement Therapy:  
•For critically ill p atients with COVID -19 who have acute kidney injury and who develop
indications for renal replacement therapy, provide continuous renal replacement therapy
(CR
RT), if available. If  CRRT is not available or not possible due to limited resources,
provide prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapy rather than intermittent
hemodialysis
Pharmacologic Interventions:  
•For the therapeutic Management of Patients with COVID -19 us e of Dexamethasone and
Remdesivir, either alone or in combination.
• In patie nts with COVID -19 and severe or critical illness, there are insufficient data to
recommend empiric broad - 
spe
ctrum antimicrobial therapy in the absence of another indication.  
Implementation of additional Precautions for suspected SARS- CoV-2 infections  
Cont act and Droplet precautions for suspected SARS- CoV-2 infection:  
-Place patients in adequately ventilated single rooms. For naturally ventilated general ward rooms
this is considered to be 160 L/second/patient;-Apply Infection prevention and control measures when providing health care where novel
coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) infection is suspected, the Interim Guidance is to:
• Place patient beds at least 1m apart;
• Where possible, cohort HCWs to exclusively care for cases to reduce the risk of spreading
transmi ssion due to inadvertent infection control breaches;
• Use of PPE (medical  mask, Use eye/facial protection (i.e. goggles or a face shield ); Use  a
clean, non- sterile, long- sleeved fluid resistant gown; Use  gloves)
• Use either single use disposable equipment or  dedicated equipment (e.g. stethoscopes,
blood pressure cuffs and thermometers). If equipment needs to be shared among patients,
clean and disinfect between each patient use (e.g. ethyl alcohol 70%);
• Refrain from touching eyes, nose or mouth with potential ly contaminated hands;
• Avoid the movement and transport of patients out of the room or area unless medically
necessary.
• Use designated portable X -ray equipment and/or other important diagnostic equipment.
• If transport is required, use pre -determined transport routes to minimize exposures to staff,
other patients and visitors and apply medical mask to patient;
• Maintain a record of all persons entering the patient’s room including all staff and visitors.
Prevention  
Application of Standard Precautions for all  patients and people at risks in the public include hand 
and respiratory hygiene; use of Personal protective equipment (PPE) depending on risk; in hospitals 
use safe waste management; environmental cleaning and sterilization of patient -care equipment and 
linen. Ensure the following respiratory hygiene measures.  
-Offer a medical mask (N95) or double cloth mask in health care settings
-Cover nose and mouth during coughing or sneezing with tissue or flexed elbow for others
-Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
Rational, correct, and consistent use of available PPE and appropriate hand hygiene helps to 
reduce the spread of the pathogens. PPE effectiveness depends on adequate and regula r supplies , 
adequate staff training, proper hand hygiene and s pecifically appropriate human behavior. 
Health care workers and Administrators should ens ure that environmental cleaning and dis infec tion 
procedures are followed consistently and correctly. Thorough cleaning of environmental 
surfaces with water and detergent and applying c ommonly used hospital level disinfec tants (such 
as sodium hypochlorite) is an effective and sufficient procedure. Laundry, food service utensils 
and medical waste should be managed in accordance with s afe routine procedures. 108	• Verify the alerts to determine if they meet the standard case definition for COVID -19
• Respond as for suspected case i f they meet the standard case definition
• Record all alerts in an alert/rumor log sheet.
• Provide epidemiological information to conduct risk assessment at the national, regional
and global level.
• Conduct epidemiological investigation to identify risk factor s for infection and population s
at risk for severe disease.
• Maintain strict acute respiratory disease infection control practices throughout theepidemic.
• Mobilize the community for early detection and care and conduct community education
about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement IPC at the home care setti ng
and during funerals and burials. Consider social distancing strategies.
• Conduct contact follow- up and active searches for additional community cases or deaths
that may not come to the he alth care setting.
• Distribute laboratory specimen collection kits to health care facilities
• Establish treatment unit to handle additional cases that may come to the health center in
line with the national protocols.
• Maintain strict acute respiratory diseas e infection control precautions and establish an
isolation ward to manage additional cases who may present for care.
.Public Health Control Measures 
• Establish an alert management system e.g call center with hotlines109		
CHAPTER FIVE MALARIA  Malaria case definition A malaria case is a person with malaria infection, confirmed by microscopy or mRDT, regardless of whether fever and other clinical symptoms are present.  5.1 Asymptomatic Malaria Case Asymptomatic malaria case can be found during Active Case Detection (ACD) by health workers in the community and in households. Therefore, all patients with parasitemia are considered “malaria cases”, regardless of whether clinical symptoms are present or not.   5.2 Symptomatic Malaria Case 5.2.1    Uncomplicated Malaria Uncomplicated malaria is defined as symptomatic malaria without signs of severity or evidence (clinical or laboratory) of vital organ dysfunction.  Clinical presentation  • Fever • Headache • Joint pains • Malaise • Vomiting • Diarrhoea • Body ache, body weakness • Poor appetite • Pallor, enlarged spleen  Investigations The recommended investigations are: • Quality malaria microscopy or quality malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests (mRDTs)   Note • It is compulsory to test and confirm all suspected malaria patients. Give antimalarial only to those who test positive. • In cases where non-response to malaria treatment (treatment failure) is suspected in patients who initially tested positive, microscopy is the recommended laboratory procedure as mRDTs are not recommended because parasite antigens persist up to 4 weeks after parasitaemia has cleared.  Non-Pharmacological Treatment • Continue with feeding and fluid intake • Followed up immediately if the condition worsens or on the fourth day if symptoms persist.  Pharmacological Treatment Drug of choice for treatment of uncomplicated malaria is: A: Artemether+Lumefantrine (FDC) (PO) 20mg+120mg   Common formulations:  • Fixed formulation Artemether 20mg, Lumefantrine120mg; 6, 12, 18 and 24 tablets blister • Fixed formulation Artemether 80mg, Lumefantrine 480mg; 6 tablets blister  Dispersible tablets: Fixed formulation for children A: Artemether 20mg + Lumefantrine120mg; 6 tablets blister (5–14kg): 1 tablet; 15–24 kg: 2 tablets)   Table 5.1: Dosage regimen forALu (artemether 20mg/lumefantrine 120mg)    Day 1 Day 2 Day 3  Kg Dose 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th Hours 0 (*) 8 24 36 48 60 Age (years) Tablets Tablets tablets tablets tablets Tablets up to 15 0 to 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 110	15 up to 25  3 up to 8  2 2 2 2 2 2

For practical purposes, a simpler dosage regimen is recommended in order to 
improve compliance: the first dose should be given as DOT; the second dose 
should strictly be given after 8 hours; subsequent doses could be gi ven 12hourly 
in the second and third day of treatment until completion of 6 doses  
The alternative medicines for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, where there is no response to 
Artemether -Lumefantrine or it is contraindicated, is Dihydroartemisinin -Piperaquine.  
C: dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine (FDC) (PO).

Clinical presentation • Prostration/extreme weakness • Impaired consciousness • Change of behaviour • Convulsions • Respiratory distress (due to lactic acidosis and/or pulmonary oedema) • Jaundice • Circulatory collapse/shock • Vomiting everything • Inability to drink or breast feed • Bleeding tendency/DIC  Investigations In severe malaria, blood slide (BS) is a recommended malaria test as it quantifies parasitemia. In severe ill patients receiving injectable antimalarial, serial BS investigations monitors level of parasitemia to verify malaria recovery, or if clinical condition is not improving to rule out another serious condition. • Blood film for malaria parasites • Blood glucose estimation in patients with altered consciousness • Haematocrit and/or haemoglobin estimation • Lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis (if facilities for LP assessment are available) • Serum creatinine or urea– to assess Kidney function 112		• Electrolytes– for early detection of acute renal failure • Full blood cell count and differential white cell count for additional diagnosis of other infectious diseases • Blood gases, pH and anion gap– to diagnose acidosis  • Radiological investigation: Chest X–ray; look for pulmonary oedema or lobar consolidation • Blood culture and sensitivity where feasible   Non-Pharmacological Treatment A rapid assessment must be conducted including airway, breathing, circulation, coma, convulsion, and dehydration status.   Referral: If effective management of severe malaria and supportive care for complications is not possible, patients should be given pre-referral treatment and referred immediately to an appropriate facility for continued treatment.  Pharmacological Treatment A: Parenteral artesunate Dosage: • 2.4 mg/kg in body weight. (IV) or (IM) given on admission (time = 0 hour), then at 12 hours and 24 hours for a minimum of 3 injections in 24 hours regardless of patient’s recovery. • Children weighing less than 20 kg Dosage: 3 mg/kg/dose (or higher). Same schedule as indicated above (0, 12, 24 hours) • Complete artesunate injection treatment by giving a complete course (3days) of artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) or other ACT. Consider broad spectrum antibiotic as treatment of septicemia.  Administration and dosage (30 mg, 60mg and 120mg strength): Injectable artesunate has 2-steps dilutions. • Step 1: The powder for injection should be diluted with 1ml of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution (provided in each box) and shaken vigorously 2–3 minutes for better dissolving until the solution becomes clear. • Step 2: For slow intravenous infusion (3–4 minutes), add 5 ml of 5% dextrose or normal saline, to obtain artesunate concentration of 10 mg/ml. For deep intra–muscular injection, add 2 ml of 5% dextrose or normal saline to obtain artesunate concentration of 20 mg/ml.

Management of complications  
To reduce the unacceptably high mortality of severe malaria, patients require intensive care. Clinical observations should be made as frequently as possible. Airway maintenance, nurse on side, fanning 
if hyperpy rexia is present, fluid balance review:  114	Coma (cerebral malaria):  maintain airway, nurse on side, and exclude other causes of coma (e.g. 
hypoglycemia, bacterial meningitis); avoid giving corticosteroids.  
Dehydration:  Correct dehydration 
Hyperpyrexia: fa nning, paracetamol if patient can swallow  
Convulsions: maintain airways; treat with 
Adult  
A: diazepam (IV) 0.15 mg/ kg (maximum 10 mg) slow bolus IV injection. 
Children  
A: diazepam (rectal) 0.5 –1.0 mg/ kg1. 
If convulsions persist after 10 minutes repeat  rectal diazepam treatment as above. Should 
convulsions continue despite a second dose, give a  further dose of rectal diazepam  
OR  
A: phenobarbitone (IM/IV) 20 mg/ kg after another 10 minutes.  
Hypoglycemia: remains a major problem in the management of severe malaria especially in young children and pregnant women. It should be deliberately looked for and treated accordingly. Urgent and repeated blood glucose screening.  
In children:  
B: dextrose 10% (IV) 5 ml/kg 
OR 
C: dextrose 25% (IV) 2.5ml/kg as bolus;   
If 50%dextrose solution is available, it should be diluted to make 25% by adding an equal volume of 
water for injection or normal saline.  
In adults:  
B: dextrose 10% (IV) 125ml 
OR 
C: dextrose 25% (IV) 50ml as bolus. 
Where dextrose is not available, s ugar water should be prepared by mixing 20g of sugar (4 –level 
teaspoons) with 200ml of clean water. 50ml of this solution is given ORALLY or by nasogastric tube 
if unconscious.

5.3 Management of Malaria in Special Groups  
5.3.1    Malaria in Pregnancy (MI P) 
The effects of malaria in pregnancy are related to the malaria  endemicity, with abortion more 
common in areas of low endemicity and intrauterine growth retardation more common in areas of 
high endemicity.  
5.3.1.1 Uncomplicated Malaria in Pregnancy  
In high -transmission areas (moderate to high immunity); malaria is usually asymptomatic in 
pregnancy or is associated with only mild, non -specific symptoms. ( See section 5.1 above ) 
Pharmacological Treatment  
Artemether/Lumefantrine (ALu) is the recommended treatment of choice  of a confirmed 
uncomplicated malaria to pregnant women in all trimesters.  
1Draw	the	IV	preparation	into	a	small	 syringe	and	remove	the	needle.	Insert	5	cm	of	a 	naso gastric	tube	into	the	rectum.	Inject	
the	diazepam	into	the	nasogastric	tube	and	flush	it	with	5	ml	of	water.	If	a	nasogastric	tube	is	not	available,	use	a	syringe 	
without	a	needle.	Hold	buttocks	together	 for	few	minutes	to	ensure	retention	and	absorption	of	the	medicine 	115	5.3.1.2 Severe Malaria in Pregnancy  
In low -transmission areas (low malaria immunity); women in the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy are more likely to develop severe malaria  than other adults, often complicated by 
pulmonary  oedema  and hypoglycaemia .  
The following are common features of severe malaria during pregnancy:  
• High fever
• Hyperparasitemia
• Low blood sugar• vere haemolytic anaemi a
• Cerebral malaria
• Pulmonary oedema
Pharmacological Treatment Intramuscular/ intravenous Artesunate is the drug of 
choice for treatment of severe malaria in all trimesters . 
5.3.1.3 Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp)  
Malaria parasites can easily accumulate and multiply in  the placenta leading to placenta malaria 
infections, resulting to complications such as maternal  anaemia , low birth weight, premature 
delivery, congenital infection and/or perinatal death. 
Note  
IPTp is an administration of antimalarial in full therapeuti c doses at predetermined intervals during 
pregnancy 
individuals with no signs/symptoms of malaria. The aim is to prevent above mentioned 
complications with adverse  
effects to both mother and fetus3 
The medicine of choice for IPTp  
A: sulphadoxine +pyrimeth amine (FDC) (PO) 500mg  +25mg 
•The dose is 3 tablets once
•A minimum of 3 doses in entire pregnancy period
•The first dose should be administered from 14 weeks of pregnancy onwards
•Each dose should be given at least 4 weeks apart
•The last dose can be adminis tered up to the time of delivery, without safety concerns
Note: 
• SP should not be administered to women receiving cotrimoxazole prophylaxis or pregnant
women who are taking folic acid at a daily dose equal or above 5 mg, as it counteracts its
efficacy
• SP can be administered safely with combined ferrous  sulphate 200mg + folic acid 0.25m g
• If malaria is diagnosed to a scheduled pregnant woman for IPT with SP; SP should not be
given, instead a full treatment with antimalarial should be given
5.3.2 Management of Malaria in Neonates  
Neonatal malaria is defined as symptoms attributable to malaria with evidence of ring forms of 
malaria parasite in the blood of an infant within the first twenty -eight days (4 weeks) of life. 
Congenital malaria is defined as sympto ms attributable to malaria with evidence of ring forms of 
malaria parasite in the blood of an infant within the first seven days (1 week) of life. The signs and 
symptoms resemble those seen in the new -born with septicemia  
Clinical presentation  
• Fever
• Lethargy
• Unable to breastfeed
• Vomiting
• Irritability
• Respiratory distress
• Seizures
• Jaundice
• Pallor
• Hepatosplenomegaly• Laboratory findings will include t he
presence of malaria parasites.116	Investigations  
• Full blood picture
• blood sugar
• blood culture and sensit ivity, blood smear for malaria parasite, serum electrolytes
• CSF for analysis
Management of neonatal malaria  
• Neonatal malaria should always be considered as severe malaria
• Neonates with suspected malaria should be admitted to hospital immediately as they c an
deteriorate quickly and die at home
• Parental Artesunate is recommended treatment of choice for neonates. Injectable Artemether
can be used as an alternative if Artesunate is not available
• Broad spectrum antibiotic as majority of severe malaria accompan ied with septicemia. Refer
septicemia treatment section.
Nursing care and monitoring  
• Monitor vital signs (PR, RR & Temperature)
• Monitor input/output
• Check BS for malaria parasite daily
• Ensure feeding
• Advise on use of LLINs
5.3.3 Management of Ma laria in HIV and AIDS P atients 
If malaria is diagnosed, depending on classification of the malaria diagnosis, a full treatment with 
antimalarial should be given according to the malaria classification. 
However, it should be noted that, clearance of parasitaemia may not necessarily be accompanied by 
clearance of symptoms (fever) due to the presence of other underlying opportunistic infections. HIV 
and AIDS infected adults with low CD4 cell counts may be more susceptible to treatment failure of 
anti-malaria drugs.  
Note  
• In suspected cerebral malaria in a HIV and AIDS patient, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
examination to rule out other life -threatening conditions such as bacterial and cryptococca l
meningitis117	CHAPTER SIX 
HIVA ND AIDS 
AIDS is defined as Acquired Immuno - Deficiency Syndrome caused by Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (HIV). Clinical features  are usually due to immune system suppression. 
Clinical presentation 
• Fever, diarrhoea, weight loss, skin rashes, sores, generalized pruritis, altered mental
status, persistent severe headache, oral thrush or Kaposi’s sarcoma may be found in
patients with advanced disease
• Opportunistic infections e.g. tuberculosis, candidiasis or pyogenic infections, Advanced
HIV Disease
6.1 Treatment of HIV and AIDS in Adults and Adolescen ts 
• All HIV infected individuals are eligible for ART. Early initiation of combination treatment(ART) is associated with health benefits in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality in all
age groups.
• Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced HI V-associated morbidity and
mortality and has transformed the HIV disease into a chronic, manageable condition. Inaddition, treatment of HIV infected individuals with ART is highly efficient at preventi ng
transmission to sexual partners and mother to child  transmission (MTCT).
Evaluation to be done before Initiating ART  
From the moment a patient tests HIV positive, he/she should be linked to the Care and Treatment Clinic (CTC). In health facilities where ART is being initiated at RCH and TB clinics, patie nts can be 
managed at those clinics. Mobile outreach clinics can also be used for key and vulnerable population and hard to reach areas.

6.1.2 ART in Women of Childbearing Potential or Pregnant W omen 
Mother -to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV refers to the transmission of HIV infections from HIV -
infected mothers to their infants. MTCT can occur during preg nancy, labour and delivery, and 
breast -feeding. Without intervention, the overall risk of MTCT is approximately 20% –45%. However, 
with interventions, this risk can be reduced to less than 5%. Transmission of HIV from mother to her 
child accounts for over 9 0% of all HIV infections in children aged below 15 years.  118	Figure 6.1 Estimated HIV Outcomes for Infants Born to Mothers Living with HIV  
6.1.3 Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission  
All HIV infected pregnant women and lactating mothe rs are eligible for ART regardless of CD4 cell 
count and clinical stage. The pregnant or breast -feeding women with HIV should be started on 
lifelong ART at the time of diagnosis.  
The recommended first line regimen is once a day fixed dose regimen of TDF +  3TC + DTG. 
Although TDF+ 3TC + EFV may be an option for use during the pre -conception period through the 
first eight weeks of pregnancy to avoid potential risk of neural tube defects. Then TLD should be 
continued postpartum  
• A women -centered approach is ado pted. Women of childbearing potential including thos e
who are using long term effective contraception should be given adequate information to
enable making informed decision and choice.
• Women should receive on -going counselling support to continue with HIV  care and
treatment in order to maintain good health and to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to
others.

Prophylaxis for HIV Exposed Infants  
• Administer NVP syrup immediately after birth to all HIV exposed infants and continue untilsix weeks of age
• In case a high risk HIV exposed infant is identified, administer duo prophylaxis containingNVP syrup (once daily) and AZ T syrup (twice daily) for the first 6 weeks of life, t
hen
continue with daily NVP alone up to 12 weeks of lifeHigh-risk infants are those who are:
o Born to women diagnosed to be living with HIV during current pregnancy or breast -
feeding period.
o women k nown to be HIV positive but not yet on ART or
o already on ART but with high viral load ( ≥50/UL of blood)
• Infant prophylaxis is most effective when given as soon as possible after birth, preferably
within 6 –12 hours
• HIV exposed infants identified beyond the age of 4 weeks should not be given ARV

For patients on TDF based regimens in first line, the preferred second line option is AZT plus 3TC combined with a ritonavir-boosted PI, preferably ATV/r because it is dosed once daily and has fewer metabolic complications and side effects. The same NRTIs, with exception of 3TC and FTC used in previous regimen should not be used in subsequent regimens during switching due to treatment failure. LPV/r can be used as an alternative to ATV/r in patients using anti-TB drugs (with ritonavir super boosting) and children below six years. Also, ATV/r (300/100mg) cannot be used in children below 30kg.   For patients who were on AZT and had never used TDF regimen, the default second line option will be TDF or ABC based regimen combined with a boosted PI (TDF+FTC+ATV/r). For patients who were introduced to TDF in first line due to AZT toxicity, the default second line option is to use ABC plus 3TC combined with a ritonavir-boosted PI ATV/r or LPV/r. (ABC+3TC + LPV/r or ATV/r). However, ABC may be rendered ineffective due to cross resistance with TDF associated resistance mutations.   6.1.5 Third-line Antiretroviral Therapy Patients failing 2nd line regimens may have extensive NRTI and NNRTIs associated resistance mutations (RAMS) which preclude/minimise their use in third-line regimens. Therefore, 3rd line Infant age NVP daily dosing Birth to 6 weeks § Birth weight 2000–2499g § Birth weight ≥2500g  10mg (1 ml) once daily 15mg(1.5ml) once daily 120regimens, in order to have at least two or preferably three effective drugs, need to be constru cted 
using other new classes of drugs or second-gener ation formulations  of previous drugs. These 
second-gener ation drugs usually have a higher genetic  barrier to resistance and their efficacy is not 
compromised by RAM s associated with the first-gener ation f ormulations . 
Therefore, this guideline recommends t he use of: 
• Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs) or Integrase Inhibitors Dolutegravir 50mg 
(DTG) and Raltegravir 400m g (RAL), 
• Second gener ation PIs Darunav ir 800m g /Ritonav ir 100m g (DRV /r),

Changi ng ART due to toxicity 
From a clinical perspect ive, it is gener ally recommended that when changi ng a client’s regimen due 
to toxicity, only the toxic drug(s) shoul d be replaced,  wherever possi ble, by a drug without 
overlapping toxicities. Table 6.5 provides guidanc e on ARV drug combinations  with some common 
toxicity subst itution within first-line regimens. 
 
  121		Table 6.5: Types of toxicities associated with first and second-line ARV drugs (Refer to National Guidelines for Management of HIV and AIDS 7th Edition 2019)  ARV Major types of toxicity Risk factors Suggested management and substitution TDF Tubular renal dysfunction, Fanconi syndrome Underlying renal disease Older age BMI <18.5 (or body weight <50kg) Untreated diabetes mellitus Untreated hypertension Concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs or a boosted PI  If TDF is being used in first-line ART, substitute it with AZT or ABC  If TDF is being used in second-line ART (AZT use in first line ART), substitute it with ABC Decreases in bone mineral density History of osteomalacia and pathological fracture Risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss Lactic acidosis or severe hepatomegaly with steatosis Prolonged exposure to nucleoside analogues Obesity Exacerbation of hepatitis B (hepatic flares) Discontinuation of TDF due to toxicity No available alternative drug in the country for treatment of hepatitis B e.g. Entecavir ABC Hypersensitivity reaction Genetic predisposition (HLA-B 5701 gene) If ABC is being used in first-line ART, substitute with TDF or AZT AZT Anaemia, neutropaenia, myopathy, lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy Baseline anaemia or Neutropaenia CD4 cell count ≤200 cells/mm3 If AZT is being used in first-line ART, substitute it with TDF or ABC  If AZT is being used in second-line ART, substitute it with ABC Lactic acidosis or severe hepatomegaly with steatosis BMI >25 (or body weight >75 kg) Prolonged exposure to nucleoside analogues     LPV/r Hepatotoxicity  Underlying hepatic disease HBV and HCV co-infection Concomitant use of hepatotoxic drugs     Replace it with ATV/r  Pancreatitis Advanced HIV disease Lipoatrophy or metabolic syndrome dyslipidaemia, severe diarrhea and risk of prematurity Risk factors unknown ATV/r Indirect hyperbilirubinaemia (clinical jaundice)   Underlying hepatic disease HBV and HCV co infection Concomitant use of hepatotoxic drugs Indirect hyperbilirunemia is usually transient and ATV/r can be continued, however, if severe jaundice develops and is associated with significantly raised transaminases, then ATV/r should be replaced with LPV/r   Nephrolithiasis and risk of prematurity Risk factors unknown Replace it with LPV/r       EFV  Persistent central nervous system toxicity (such as dizziness, abnormal dreams, depression or mental confusion) Depression or other mental disorder (previous or at baseline) Taking with high fat meal Replace it with DTG or NVP.

123		6.2.2 Changing ART due to Treatment Failure  Table 6.6: WHO definitions of treatment failure in chronological order of occurrence: virological, immunological and clinical failure for the decision to switch ART regimens  Failure Definition Comments Virological Plasma viral load above 1000 copies/ ml based on two consecutive viral load measurements after 3 months, with adherence support An individual must be taking ART for at least six months before it can be determined that a regimen has failed.  Immunological  CD4 cell count falls to the baseline (or below)  or Persistent CD4 levels below 100 cells/mm3 Without concomitant or recent infection or steroid use to cause a transient decline in the CD4 cell count Immunological and clinical characteristics of treatment failure develop much later after virological failure. Immunological and clinical criteria of treatment failure may also misclassify treatment failure and lead to unnecessary ARV switch to subsequent (line of treatment) regimen Clinical  New or recurrent clinical event indicating severe immunodeficiency (WHO clinical stage 4 conditions) after six months of effective treatment. The condition must be differentiated from IRIS   Switching to Third-line ARV regimens It is crucial that before a regimen is declared to have failed, a multidisplinary switch team is convened to rule out non-adherence which is the commonest cause of reduced CD4 cell count and a VL rise but is often not associated with HIV drug resistance. This team will also plan for enhanced adherence and support, for a period of 3 months before a second VL test. In case of non-adherence, these measures will lower the VL, increase CD4 cell count and avert a switch to a subsequent regimen    Before switching to third-line ARV regimens, genotypic HIV drug resistance is recommended to rule cross resistance between 1st and 2nd generation drugs and assist in the determination of whether treatment failure is from non-adherence. Genotyping will also inform possibility of recycling drugs used in previous regimens i.e. some drugs used in 1st or 2nd regimens may still be effective in third-line.  6.3 Monitoring Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy Monitoring of patients on ART is based on clinical and laboratory parameters. Refer table 6.7  Table 6.7 Clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients on first line drug regimen  Regimens Monitoring Tests Frequency Rationale TDF+3TC+DTG ABC+3TC+DTG AZT+3TC+ (EFV or NVP) TDF+FTC+ (EFV or NVP) HVL (All Clients) For HVL monitoring, refer to HVL algorithm ART monitoring CD4 (All clients) Baseline (All) After every six months if CD4 is <350 cells/ml ART monitoring FBP/Hb (All clients) If a client has Hb Baseline, week 4, thereafter six monthlies Anaemia monitoring 124		<8.5g/dl avoid AZT Serum Creatinine (For patients on TDF) Baseline, and after every six months and whenever symptomatic Screening for early renal toxicity ALT (For patients on DTG or NVP) Baseline, one month, after every six months and whenever symptomatic Liver toxicity AZT+3TC+ATV/r TDF+FTC+ATV/r ABC+3TC+LPV/r or DTG Bilirubin (For all clients on ATV/r) Baseline, 6 months or whenever symptomatic Indirect hyper-bilirubinaemia   Note Clinical evaluation will determine more frequent laboratory tests if required.  Laboratory monitoring of patients on second line drugs The following laboratory tests are recommended for Monitoring of patients on second line drugs: • FBC, baseline, then monthly for 3 months, then after every 6 months (with CD4 and viral load) • Fasting cholesterol and triglyceride, baseline, 6 months and thereafter every 12 months • Liver function tests, (ALT) 6 monthly • Fasting glucose, every 12 months • Urinalysis at baseline and after every 3 months • Serum creatinine at baseline and once a year.  When changing treatment, the following should be observed: • Never change a single drug in the combination if the reason for changing is treatment failure. Change at least two drugs, preferably change all three drugs • If changing due to toxicity, change only the drug suspected to be causing the problem. • Never change to monotherapy (i.e. single drug)  • When selecting drugs, choose drugs that have not been used before, drugs which do not have cross-resistance/or no overlapping toxicities or drug-drug interactions.  • Lamivudine has advantage of decreasing viral fitness therefore it may be retained when changing the failing regimen 6.4 Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) IRIS is a phenomenon associated with the occurrence or worsening of opportunistic infections/malignancies which can occur early after initiation of ART or at later (several months) during ART. There is an increased risk for occurrence of IRIS in the following situations:  • Treatment naïve patients  • Patients with advanced HIV disease with CD4 cell count < 50 cells/mm3  • Patients with undiagnosed and untreated opportunistic conditions • Patients who have been introduced on ART before or shortly after initiation of treatment of opportunistic infection/malignancy • In the advent of DTG use, there is increased likelihood for IRIS because of rapid HIV viral load suppression.  Note Any OI, malignancy and autoimmune diseases may present as IRIS  Diagnostic Criteria: The criteria for making a diagnosis of IRIS are delineated below  125		Diagnosis of IRIS would require: Both major (A plus B) criteria or criterion A plus 2 minor criteria Major criteria A. A typical presentation of “opportunistic infections or tumours” in patients responding to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) includes: • Localized disease e.g. lymph nodes, liver, spleen • Exaggerated inflammatory reaction e.g. severe fever, with exclusion of other causes of painful lesions • Atypical inflammatory response in affected tissues e.g. granulomas, suppuration, necrosis, perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltrate • Progression of organ dysfunction or enlargement of pre-existing lesions after definite, clinical improvement with pathogen specific therapy prior to commencement of ART and exclusion of treatment toxicity and new diagnoses • Development or enlargement of cerebral space occupying lesions after treatment for cerebral cryptococcus or toxoplasmosis • Progressive pneumonitis or the development of organizing pneumonia after treatment of pulmonary-TB or PCP • New onset or worsening of uveitis/vitritis after resolution of CMV retinitis • Fever and cytopenia after treatment for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease • Enlargement of Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions and subsequent resolution or partial regression without • Commencement of radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy or intralesional therapy B. Decrease in plasma HIV-RNA level by > 1 log base ten copies/ml (1 log drop = 9/10 of Baseline VL copies). This applies in settings where baseline VL is performed.   Minor criteria • Increased blood CD4+ cell count after initiation of ART • Increase in immune response specific to the relevant pathogen e.g. delayed type hypersensitivity to mycobacterial antigens (PPD conversion) • Spontaneous resolution of disease without specific antimicrobial therapy or tumour chemotherapy with continuation of anti-retroviral therapy.  Treatment of IRIS Mild to moderate forms: • Reassure the patient and do not stop ART • Provide specific treatment for the opportunistic infections/malignancies or other diseases  Severe life-threatening IRIS • Reassure the patient and Stop ART temporarily • Provide high doses of prednisolone 1mg/kg for 4 weeks then taper down the dose.  • Provide other appropriate supportive measures such as management of fever, oxygen therapy, i.e. fluids • Restart ART when the patient stabilizes.  Note When using high dose steroids, it is important to rule out Strogyloides stecolaris infection to avoid disseminated strongylodiasis.   6.5   Antiretroviral Therapy in Children and Adolescents Living with HIV ART in children has been proven to increase survival and decrease HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Children should be started on ART as soon they are diagnosed including those who are presumably diagnosed.    126		Table 6.9: When to start ART in Children Under 15 Years  Age When you start Children 0-15 years Treat all of them regardless of WHO clinical stage or CD4 cell count Children below 18 months old who qualify for presumptive diagnosis Start ART while awaiting for DNA-PCR confirmation test results.

For TB and HIV co-infected on TLD TDF+3TC+DTG  For children 20-25   kg who get TB/HIV co-infection it is advisable to give them TDF+3TC+EFV for the time of the TB treatment then revert to TDF+3TC+DTG after completion of TB Treatment For children > 25 kg  Continue with the same regimen, Double dose of DTG  TLD in the morning and only DTG (50mg) in the evening  
  For dosing of ARV regimens see Annex 6, Paediatric Antiretroviral Dosing  Note Children with weight above 30kg can use TDF as a fixed dose combination with 3TC.  Special Considerations for LPV/r syrup, granules and tablets • The LPV/r liquid requires a cold chain only during storage at the facility  • After dispensing, the liquid is stable at room temperature for 1 month so patients should be given a maximum of 1-month supply   • Patients do not have to refrigerate the LPV/r liquid  • LPV/r granules for infants who can safely swallow LPV/r granules but who are unable to swallow LPV/r tablets whole.  128		• LPV/r tablet is heat stable but must be swallowed whole and should not be split or crushed as it loses effectiveness   6.6. Changing ART in Children Under 15 Years  I. Drug toxicity  The principles for changing ARVs and the managing drug toxicity in children are like those applied to adults.  II. Treatment failure Virological treatment failure: Viral load is the most reliable method to detect early treatment failure. Virological treatment failure is recognized if the child is adherent to the current ART regimen, for 6 months or more and has two consecutive viral load measurements over 1000 copies/ml at 3 months apart.   Immunological treatment failure: If adherence is good, immunological criteria indicating that a change to second-line therapy is warranted where/when HVL test is not available includes the following:  Table 6.11: CD4 Criteria Suggesting Immunological Failure a Immunological failure is recognized as developing or returning to the following age-related immunological thresholds after at least 6 months on ART, in a treatment-adherent child: <5 years of age CD4 count of <200 cells/mm3 or CD4 <10% ≥5 years of age CD4 count of <100 cells/mm3 a Preferably, at least two CD4 measurements should be available    Use of CD4 in children <5 years and absolute CD4 cell counts in those ≥5 years of age is preferred. If serial CD4 values are available, the rate of CD4 cell count declines from the peak, CD4 cell count reached should be taken into consideration.  Note CD4 cell percent should not be measured during an inter-current infection but can be determined when the child has recovered.  If there is a modest decline in CD4 cell count or percent (< 5%); and if there is no failure to thrive do not change medication, instead maintain close monitoring.  Clinical Treatment Failure: Clinical conditions indicating that a change to second-line therapy is warranted include: • Poor growth (failure to gain weight, declining or stagnant weight) over a 6-month period, after excluding other causes, such as TB, feeding problems and food insecurity • No improvement of neuro-developmental milestones • Development of HIV encephalopathy  • Recurrent infections, such as oral candidiasis, persistent diarrhoea, recurrent severe bacterial pneumonia • Advancement from one clinical stage to another or new evidence of new WHO stage 3 or 4 disease   Note • Short inter-current episodes of pneumonia, LRTI and gastroenteritis should not be regarded as clinical failure • Pulmonary or lymph node TB, which are clinical stage 3 conditions, are not indications of treatment failure, and thus may not require consideration of second-line therapy  • The response to TB therapy should be used to evaluate the need for switching therapy • Before an ARV regimen is thought to be failing based on clinical criteria, the child should have received the regimen for at least 6 months. • The condition must be differentiated from immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.   129		Table 6.12: Laboratory parameters for monitoring infants and children under 15 years at baseline, before and during ART Laboratory tests for diagnosis and monitoring Baseline (at entry into care) At initiation of first-line or second-line ART regimen Every six months As required or symptom- directed HIV diagnostic testing √    Haemoglobin √ √  √ WBC and differential count  √   √ %CD4+ or absolute CD4 cell count √  √b √ Pregnancy testing in adolescent girls  √  √ Full chemistry (including, but not restricted to, liver enzymes, renal function, glucose, lipids, amylase, lipase and serum electrolytes) e  √ √e √ HIV VL measurement   √d √ OI screening (where possible) √ √ √ √ a.

CD4 cell count should be taken on emergence of WHO stage 3 or 4 disease d. Viral load monitoring is done annually if the first two VL results 6th month apart are <1000 copies/mL e. Regular monitoring (every six months) of full chemistry, particularly lipid levels, liver enzymes and renal functions, should be considered for infants and children on ART.  Assessment of Infants and Children receiving ARV Therapy Important clinical signs of response to ARV therapy in children include improvement in growth and development and decreased frequency of infections (bacterial infections, oral thrush, and/or other opportunistic infections).  Clinical monitoring of ARV treatment in children should include: • Feeding practice and nutritional status  • Growth monitoring: weight, height, MUAC (mid-upper arm circumference) • Head circumference should be monitored in children under 3 years old • Neurologic symptoms and developmental milestones • Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis taken daily • Adjustment of ARV dose based on weight • WHO disease clinical staging • Immunization status • Other medical conditions • Screening for malaria and TB.          130		Table 6.13: Recommended Second-line ARV regimens for children under 15 years Patient group If is on the following first line Preferred 2L Comments Children and adolescents <20kg   whose 1st regimen was EFV or NVP based, then transitioned to LPV/r based regimen ABC/3TC+LPV/r  AZT/3TC+LPV/r Maintain PI  AZT/3TC+LPV/r -Higher genetic resistance barrier -Spare INSTI for third-line  Children and adolescents ≥20kg whose 1st regimen was EFV or NVP based, then transitioned to DTG based regimen  ABC/3TC+DTG  AZT/3TC+DTG AZT/3TC+ATV/r AZT/3TC+DTG ABC/3TC+DTG (for those who cannot tolerate AZT) Maintain DTG in the 2nd  line due to higher genetic barrier than PIs. Children and adolescents weighing ≥30kg TDF/3TC/DTG AZT+3TC+ATV/r ABC+3TC+ATV/r   Note • Infant and children take longer time to attain adequate viral suppression. Before confirming treatment failure, calculate drop in VL (using 0.5 log two years and above, 0.7log below 2 years- for further details on how to convert VL into numbers. • ATV/r can be used as an alternative to LPV/r in children above 6 years old if paediatric formulation is available but adolescents >30kg can take adult formulation.  Third-Line ARV regimens in children under 15 years and adolescents Clients failing 2nd line regimen have extensive NRTI and NNRTIs associated resistance mutations which minimise their use in third-line regimens. Third-line regimen is constructed using new classes of drugs or second-generation formulations, in order to have at least two or three effective drugs. For examples, Darunavir (DRV) is a second-generation PI without cross resistance to Lopinavir/r used in the previous regimens.  Criteria for Change to Third line  Failing any 2nd line regimen • Referral to specialist care is recommended where third line regimen can be chosen according to genotype resistance testing and managed by an expert panel at tertiary care facilities. • The criteria for diagnosing second-line failure are the same as those used for diagnosing first-line failure.   Eligibility for Third Line Evaluation:  All clients should have undergone an Enhanced Adherence Counselling  • Failing 2nd line regimens • Documented virologic failure (VL > 1000) on a PI regimen; except children below 3 years  Third-line Regimens for Children and Adolescents Selection of third-line regimen should consider genotype resistance test results as well as treatment history.    131		 Table 6.14: Third-line Regimens for Children and Adolescents Patient group 3L Options Justification Children <20kg RAL + DRV/r + AZT+3TC DRV/r -High genetic barrier, Effective for patients with resistance to LPVr and ATVr, cannot be used in children <3 years of age RAL-Can be used for children <20 kg DTG-Can be used for children >20 kg Children >20kg and above  DTG + DRV/r + AZT+3TC  Adverse reactions in childrenand adolescents Drug-related adverse reactions while on ART can occur immediately (soon after a drug has been administered), early (within the first days or weeks of treatment) or later (after months of treatment). Adverse reactions can vary in severity from mild to severe to life-threatening and may be specific to the drug or general to the class of drugs in use.   Table 6.15: Major Types of ARV Toxicity in Children and adolescents ABC  ABC is associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Patients may have severe skin rashes or other non-specific symptoms such as fever, arthralgias and lymph node enlargement.  AZT AZT is associated with risk of haematological toxicity which can include anaemia neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Measuring haemoglobin is recommended before initiating ART among children with low body weight, low CD4 cell counts and advanced HIV disease. Patients with severe anaemia at baseline (haemoglobin < 7.5 g/dL) should avoid AZT as first line therapy. TDF  TDF is associated with nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity is more common in elderly patients, but it also occurs in children, especially if co-administered with PI based therapy. Monitoring of creatinine clearance is recommended.  EFV  EFV’s main type of toxicity is central nervous system side effects, which typically resolve after few weeks. However, in some cases, they can persist for months or never resolve at all.  NVP  NVP’s major toxicities include severe skin rash and hypersensitivity reaction (Steven’s Johnson syndrome) and hepatotoxicity. Because of the risk of potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity associated with NVP, hepatic dysfunction of any aetiology in a child on NVP requires careful consideration of whether NVP should be continued.  LPV/r  LPV/r’s major toxicity includes hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, diarrhoea and lipoatrophy.  The risk of hepatotoxicity is increased in patients with underlying hepatic disease and the risk of pancreatitis is increased in patients with advanced HIV disease.  Electro-cardiac abnormalities are also possible; patients with pre-existing conduction system disease are at increased risk  ATV/r  Toxicities of ATV/r are like those of LPV/r. ATV/r can cause jaundice (indirect hyperbilirubinemia). Jaundice (indirect hyperbilirubinemia) is usually transient and ATV/r can be continued. If severe jaundice develops and there are significantly raised transaminases, then ATV/r should be replaced with LPV/r DRV/r  DRV/r’s major toxicity is hepatotoxicity. Patients with underlying hepatic disease, hepatitis B or C co-infection or who are taking other hepatotoxic drugs are at higher risk. The other side effect is severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions. Patients with sulphonamide allergy are at higher risk   RAL  RAL’s potential toxicity includes rhabdomyolysis, myopathy and myalgia as well as hepatitis and hepatic failure and severe skin rash and hypersensitivity reactions.   DTG  DTG major toxicity is hepatotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. Patients with underlying liver disease or hepatitis B or C co-infection are at higher risk.  Principles in the management of ARV drug toxicity Severe life-threatening reactions:Immediately discontinue all ARV drugs, manage the medical event (i.e. provide symptomatic and supportive therapy) and reintroduce ARV drugs using a modified regimen (i.e. with an ARV substitution for the offending drug) when the patient is stabilized     132	Severe reactions : Substitute the offending drug without stopping ART 
Moderate reactions : Consider continuation of ART if it is feasible. If the patient does not improve on 
symptomatic therapy, consider single- drug substitution  
Mild reactions : Reassure a ch ild and caregiver that while the reaction may be bothersome, it does 
not require a change in therapy; provide counselling and support to mitigate adverse reactions.  
Emphasize on the maintenance of adherence despite mild and moderate reactions.

6.7   HIV Prevention 
6.7.1 Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)  
Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) is the immediate provision of preventive measures and medication 
following exposure to potentially infected blood or other bodi ly fluids in order to minimize the risk of 
acquiring infection. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that HIV transmission can be 
reduced by 81% following immediate administration of antiretroviral agents.  
Effective post -exposure management entails the following elements: 
• Management of exposure site
• Exposure reporting
• Assessment of infection risk
• Appropriate treatment
• Follow- up and counselling.
When an exposure occurs, the circumstances and post exposure management procedure applied 
should be recor ded in the exposed person’s confidential form for easy follow up and care.  
Evaluation of the Exposed Individuals  133	Individuals exposed to HIV should be evaluated within two hours and no later than 72 hours. A 
starter pack should be initiated within 2 hours after exposure and before testing the exposed person. 
Exposed healthcare workers should be counselled and tested for HIV at baseline in order to establish infection status at the time of exposure. PEP should be discontinued if an exposed healthcare worker refuses to test. Vaccination against Hepatitis B should be considered.  
In addition, rape survivors should be:  
• Offered counselling, crisis prevention and provision of an on -going psychosocial support to
reduce/minimize immediate rape trauma disorder and lon g-term post -traumatic stress
disorder should be offered.
• Referred to mental care, police and legal services, according to the law and regulations.
Evaluation of the Source Person  
Evaluation of the source person should be performed when the exposed indivi dual agrees to take 
PEP.  
• If the HIV, HBV and HCV status of the source person is unknown perform these tests after
obtaining consent. The exposed healthcare worker should not be involved in obtaining
consent from the source person.
• If the source person is unknown, evaluation will depend on other risk criteria.
• Do not test discarded needles or syringes for viral contamination.
ARVs used for HIV PEP  
Adults  
A: TDF 300mg+3TC 300mg+DTG 50mg (FDC) (PO) 24hourly for 4weeks  
Children  (based on body weight)  
A: AZT+ 3TC+LPV/r 12hourly for 4weeks 
Children whose weight is more than 20kg DTG can be used instead of LPV/r and maintain AZT+3TC 
as backbone.  
Note  
If the source is using PI based regimen, then the PEP regimen should be PI based. (Similar to the source’s regim en) 
Follow -up of HIV Exposed individuals  
HIV antibody tests should be performed at least after 4 –6 weeks’ post -exposure (i.e. at 6 & 12 
weeks). HIV testing should also be performed for any exposed person who has an illness that is 
compatible with an acut e retroviral syndrome, irrespective of the interval since exposure. 
If PEP is administered, the exposed person should be monitored for drug toxicity at baseline and 2 weeks after starting PEP. Minimally, it should include a Full Blood Count (FBC), renal f unction test 
(RFT -Serum creatinine and urinalysis) and hepatic function tests (LFT-  ALT).  
Exposed persons should be re -evaluated within 72 hours, after additional information about the 
source of exposure including serologic status, viral load, current tre atment, any resistance test 
results (if available) or information about factors that would modify recommendations, is obtained.  
PEP should be administered for 4 weeks if tolerated. If not tolerated manage symptoms accordingly and if intolerance persists, change to more tolerable PI based regimen. If the patient seroconverts 
and the exposed person becomes HIV infected, he/she should be referred to a CTC for proper care 
and treatment service.  
6.7.2 Pre- Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)  
Pre-Exposure  Prophylaxis  (PrEP) is the use of ARV drugs daily by HIV uninfected persons to 
prevent acquisition of HIV before the person becomes exposed to HIV. PrEP is used by people who 
are at substantial risk for HIV acquisition to lower their chances of getting HIV infection.  Evaluation of the Exposed Individuals 134Eligible clients for PrEP 
• Aged 15 years and older
•HIV sero negativ e
•At substantial risk* of HIV infection
•No suspicion of acute HIV infection
*Subst antial risk of HIV infection means:
• Vaginal or anal sex without a condom  with more than one partner
• History of a new sexually  transmitted i nfection
• Use of post expos ure prophyl axis for sexual expos ure
• Has a known HIV positive sexual  partner(s ) who is not on ART/ on ART less than six
months or refuses t o report a risk category but still request s PrEP
Clients who are not eligible for PrEP include:  
• Acute HIV Infection (AHI)
• Client with eGFR* <60m l/min
• Significantly mobile  persons that will not be able to attend visits as prescribed. For
exam ple:
o clients who will not be in a region where PrEP can be provided at the next visit
o clients who do not have contact information
• Unwilling/ unabl e to take daily medication
• Allergy or contra indication to any medication within PrEP regimen.
ARVs used for PrEP  
The recommended PrEP regimen in Tanzani a is: 
A:Emtricitabine200m g+Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate300m g(PO) 24hour ly. 
Indications for PrEP discont inuation 
Individuals taking PrEP require ongoi ng risk assessm ent and PrEP can be discontinued if individuals 
acquire HIV infection, are no longer  at substantia l risk for HIV infection or decide to use other 
effective prevention methods  and poor adher ence. 
Before discont inuation of PrEP, clients should be provided for at least 28 days  after the last possi ble 
expos ure to HIV. The client should return after completing the final prescription for an HIV test to 
confirm status. Refer the client to  other re levant prevention services.

Prophylaxis 135		CHAPTER SEVEN TUBERCULOSIS AND LEPROSY  7.1General Management of Tuberculosis Tuberculosis is chronic airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is transmitted from one person to another when a patient is cough, sneezing or singing.   Clinical presentation • Cough of more than two weeks or of any duration in among PLHIV • Fever • Excessive night sweats • Haemoptysis (sputum mixed with blood stains) • Loss of weight • Others includes swelling of lymph nodes, ascites, difficulty in breathing, chest pain, swelling of joints etc., depending on the site of the disease  Investigations • Sputum- smears microscopy or sputum for rapid molecular tests like Gene –Expert • Culture and sensitivity; this is done for diagnosis of drug resistance and surveillance • Chest X-rays: done to assist clinical diagnosis of TB or in case of triaging presumptive  Note.  • Conduct HIV provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC)for all TB patients • Conduct Provider Initiated TB screening (PITS) for all health facility outpatients and inpatients  For detailed diagnosis and investigation of TB refer to ‘Manual for the Management of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Tanzania’.  Pharmacological Treatment  TB treatment is divided into two phases: • Initial /intensive phase, which consists of:  • RHZE for 2 months - new and re-treatment cases • Continuation phase, which consists of: • RH for 4 months - new and re-treatment cases • RH for 10 months for severe forms TB such TB meningitis, Miliary TB and TB of the spine   Table 7.1 Recommended daily doses – regimens of first-line anti-TB drugs for adults and children  New/Retreatments Initial Phase  Continuation Phase  New/Retreatments Rifampicin + Isoniazid + Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol in fixed dose (RHZE) for 2 months Rifampicin + Isoniazid in fixed dose (RH) for 4 months  Table 7.2 Daily dosage of anti-TB drugs (FDCs) in new and retreatment adult patients  Body weight Number of tablets in initial phase: 2 months (R150/H75/Z400/E275) mg Number of tablets in continuation phase: 4 months (R150/H75) mg 21–30 kg 2 2 31–50 kg 3 3 51–74 kg 4 4 ≥75 kg 5 5         136Table 7.3 Daily dosages of anti-TB Drugs (FDCs) in new and retreatment paediatric patients

7.1.1 Drug Resistance Tube rculosis (DR-TB) 
It is a laboratory diagnosi s confirmed after testing Mycobact erium tuberculosis strains for resistance 
using WHO recommended rapid genot ypic tests like gene -exper t or conventional  phenot ypic culture 
and DST. 
 
Clinical present ation 
The features are the same as suscept ible tuberculosis but patient’s  shows resistance to the first line 
treatments. Signs and symptoms of DR-TB are like those of drug-suscept ible TB (cough,  bloody  
stained sputum, fever, night sweats and weight loss).  Patients with the following features have high 
DR-TB risk (presum ptive DR-TB patients) 
• History of previous TB treatment 
o Treatment fa ilure after using first-line anti-TB medicines 
o Relapse and return after loss to follow-up, without recent tr eatment fa ilure 
o Patients who remain sputum smear-positive at month two or later during 
treatment of TB using first-line anti TB medicines  
• Close contact of a known DR-TB case  
• Health care workers presenting with TB symptoms. 
• Vulnerable groups  in congregate settings (prisoners, urban poor, miners, PWIDs) 
 
All presumptive DR-TB cases adults and children must receive the Xpert MTB/RIF test as the initial 
diagnos tic test to ensure universal coverage of DST 
 
Pharmacological Treatment 
When you diagnos e RR/MDR TB communi cate with DTLC for initiation of treatment.

Table 7.7 Special considerations for ART in TB/HIV co-infected patients Start ART for all TB patients living with HIV irrespective of CD4 counts  Treat TB first and start ART as soon as possible, preferably within two weeks of initiating treatment  Already on ART at TB diagnosis  Refer to HIV and AIDS chapter    Also, the following shall be considered in treatment of TB patients:  Pregnancy  Anti-TB is safe during pregnancy and breast feeding.  TB Prevention; TPT is offered to: • Under 5 household contacts of bacteriologically confirmed PTB cases who have no active TB. • All PLHIV who have no active TB.  Dosage In adult and adolescent  A: isoniazid (PO) 300mg 24hourly for 6months to complete one cycle of TPT  In children A: isoniazid (PO) 10mg/kg (10-15 mg/kg) 24hourly for 6months.   Note • TPT should only be given in one cycle in lifetime and no repeat cycle is needed. • People living with HIV who successfully completed their TB treatment should immediately receive TPT for six months.  • In case of neuropathy due to INH, Pyridoxine should be used for treatment of neuropathy.  • TB Preventive Therapy is not contraindicated in pregnancy and it can be given during any trimester.  Breast feeding: In the mothers with pulmonary tuberculosis, the baby should receive INH preventive (5mg/kg) for 6 months followed by BCG vaccination.    Oral contraceptives: Rifampicin interacts with oral contraceptives and reduces the efficacy of this contraception.   139		Liver disease: Most of anti-TB medicines can cause liver damage. In case a patient develops jaundice, treatment should be stopped and restarted as soon as the jaundice resolves. In severely ill patients, start moxifloxacin and ethambutol only.   Renal failure: Ethambutol is excreted by the kidneys and should either be avoided or given in a reduced dose.             7.2 General Treatment of Leprosy Leprosy is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves and the mucous membranes. Leprosy is the commonest cause of peripheral neuritis in the world.   Clinical presentation Presence of any one among the three cardinal signs of leprosy below: • Skin patch with loss of sensation • One or more enlarged peripheral nerves • Presence of leprosy bacilli–positive smear   Classification of Leprosy  Multibacillary (MB) Leprosy  • Patients with six or more leprosy skin lesions  • Positive skin smear   Paucibacillary (PB) Leprosy  • Patients with one to five leprosy skin lesions   • Negative skin smear   Note • If there is any doubt regarding the classification, the patient should be classified and treated as a multi-bacillary case.   Pharmacological Treatment Patients should be treated by multidrug combination therapy; dosage may depend with classification and whether patient is adult or children  Table 7.8 Treatment of Leprosy Classification Medicine dosage Duration of treatment Adult MB: 15years and above Day 1: Rifampicin 600mg (2x 300mg) +Clofazimine 300mg (3 x 100mg) + Dapsone 100mg. Daily Treatment: Day 2–28, Clofazimine 50mg + Dapsone 100mg   12 blister packs to be taken within a period of between 12–18 months   Child MB: below 15years Day 1: Rifampicin 450mg (3 x 150mg) + Clofazimine 150mg (3 x 50mg) + Dapsone 50mg. Daily Treatment: Day 2–28 Clofazimine 50mg every other day + Dapsone 50mg daily. 12 blister packs to be taken within a period of between 12–18 months    Adult PB: 15years and above Day 1: Rifampicin 600mg (2x 300mg) +Clofazimine 300mg (3 x 100mg) + Dapsone 100mg. Daily Treatment: Day 2–28, Clofazimine 50mg + Dapsone 100mg   6 blister packs to be taken within a period of between 6–9 months   Child PB: below 15years Day 1: Rifampicin 450mg (3 x 150mg) + Clofazimine 150mg (3 x 50mg) + Dapsone 50mg. Daily Treatment: Day 2–28 Clofazimine 50mg every other day + Dapsone 50mg daily. 6 blister packs to be taken within a period of between 6–9 months    7.2.1 Treatment of Leprosy in Special Cases Tuberculosis: Patients suffering from both tuberculosis and leprosy require appropriate anti-Tuberculosis therapy in addition to the MDT. Rifampicin must be given in the dose required for the treatment of tuberculosis. Once the intensive phase of anti TB treatment is completed, the patient should continue with his/her monthly rifampicin for leprosy treatment.    140		There are two types of reactions • Reverse Reaction or type I reaction  • Erythema Nodosum Leprous (ENL) or type II reaction (For detail refer Manual for the Management of Tuberculosis and Leprosy in Tanzania)    Treatment of Reaction: Depending on severity, treatment of reverse reaction is by giving anti- inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids usually prednisolone for a prolonged period.    Note Health care worker should communicate with DTLC and RTLC when suspect leprosy reaction      141	CHAPTER EIGHT 
NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE CONDITIONS

8.1.1.4 Brain Abscess  
Brain abscess is a focal collection of purulent material within the brain parenchyma, which can arise 
as a complication of a variety of local cranial or remote systemic infections, trauma, or surgery. The 
manifestations of brain  abscess depend on the site, size, and the immune status of the patient.  
Clinical presentation  
• Headache
• Fevers
• Seizures• Focal neurological deficit
• Altered mental status that may
progress to coma
Imaging Investigations  
• Contrast head CT scan --can demonst rate a ring enhancing lesion and possible source of
infection e.g., from paranasal sinuses, ear infections
• Contrast brain MRI with diffusion weighted sequences (DWI)
• MR spectroscopy to distinguish from brain tumors where diagnosis is unclear
• CXR
• ECHO in su spected valvular heart disease
Lab Investigations  
• Gram stain, C/S of pus from possible sources
• Purulent aspirate from the abscess for C/S
• Ziehl Neelsen stain

added for  the entire duration of anticonvulsants treatment especially in women of childbearing 
age. 
Surgical management  
•Refer all patients diagnosed with a brain abscess for neurosurgical evaluation.
•Surgical options include stereotactic abscess aspiration and c raniotomy for abscess
excision. In cases where the source of
infection is paranasal sinuses or ear infection, involve concomitant ENT surgeon
evaluation for primary source control interventions.
8.1.2 Fungal Infections  
Cryptococcus Meningitis (CM)  
CM is t he most common form of fungal meningitis worldwide. It often develops in patients who are 
immune compromised e.g., HIV -positive patients with low CD4 cell count, diabetic mellitus and 
iatrogenic immunosuppression, as in post organ transplant patients.  
Clinical features  
•Headache, fever, intolerance to light
and sound,
•Neck stiffness, vomiting, seizures,
deafness, impaired vision•In advanced stages it may presen t
with confusion,
•Altered mental status that may
progress to coma.
Investigations  
•CSF gram st ain
•CSF India Ink stain test
•Serum or CSF Cryptococcus antigen (CrAg) test
•CSF cultures
•Contrast brain MRI145	o may demonstrate cryptococcomas
o assist to rule out differential diagnoses
Pharmacological Treatment  
The treatment should be done in 3 phases:  
Phase 1: Induction phase  
S: amphotericin B (IV) 0.7 -1mg/kg/day 
AND 
S: 5 flucytosine (PO)100mg/kg/day for 7days followed by 1 week of 
AND 
A: fluconazole (PO): Adult 1200mg/day,  
Children/adolescents 2mg/kg/day, up to a maximum dose of 800mg daily 
In the ab sence of flucytosine, alternative therapy should be:  
S: amphotericin B (IV) if available give 3 -6mg/kg for 10days 
AND 
A: fluconazole (PO) 1200mg once daily for 14days  
OR 
C: fluconazole (IV) 1200mg once daily for 14days  
Phase 2: Consolidation phase  
A: fluconazole (PO) 800mg/day for 8weeks or until CSF is sterile.  
Phase 3: Maintenance phase 
A: fluconazole (PO) 200mg 24hourly for 1year  
Discontinue maintenance treatment if CD4 ≥100 with undetectable (<50 copies), viral load or CD4 ≥ 
200 if viral load monitoring not available.  
Note  
•It is recommended to initiate ART 5 weeks after initiation of Cryptococcal meningitis
treatment in ART naïve patient to prevent IRIS and reduce mortality .
•Mo nitor creatinine, BUN, serum Potassium and magnesium in all patients  on Amphotericin
B every 24hours.
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
•Refer to section on bacterial meningitis in unconscious patients.
•Perform serial Lumbar puncture for management of increased ICP in cryptococcal
meningitis. Opening pressure should be measur ed during LP and therapeutic CS F
drainage done (20- 30ml per session) for pressures >25cm H2O.
•Failure to control ICP after several LPs (recommended 3 attempts) should prompt
neurosurgical evaluation for ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion to divert CSF.
Note  
The usage of Mannitol, Hypertonic saline, acetazolamide, or corticosteroids to manage increased 
ICP in Cryptococcal meningitis is ineffective and NOT recommended.  
8.1.3 Protozoa infections  
Toxoplasmosis  
Immunocompetent persons with primary infecti on are usually asymptomatic, but latent infection can 
persist for the life of the host. In immunosuppressed patients, especially patients with AIDS, the 
parasite can reactivate and cause disease, usually when the CD4 lymphocyte count falls below 100 
cells/ mm3. 
Clinical presentation  
• Altered mental status
• Focal neurological deficits• Seizures
• Neuropsychiatric manifestations146	Imaging Investigations  
• Contrast head CT scan- demonstrates ring -enhancing lesions
• Contrast brain MRI with diffusion weighted sequenc es (DWI)

undetectable viral load for 3 -6months  
For those allergic to sulphur replace Sulfadiazine with 
S: clindamycin (PO) 450mg 6hourly for for 6weeks. 
8.1.4 Helminthic infections 
 Neurocysticercosi s (NCC)  
NCC is a neurologic infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Taenia solium . In the 
developing world NCC is the most common cause of new onset acquired epilepsy among the adult 
population. Humans are the definitive hosts for this parasit e, and swine are the intermediate hosts. 
The mature tapeworm develops in humans after they ingest live cysticercus in undercooked pork. 
NCC develops when humans accidentally ingest eggs from fecal contaminated food.  
Clinical presentation  
• Headache
• Seizur es
• Focal neurological deficit• Features of increased intracranial
pressure
Imaging Investigations

Surgical management  
•Refer all patients diagnosed with CNS cysticercosis associated with clinical or radiological
features of increased intracranial pressure from hydrocephalus for neurosurgica l
evaluation directed at management of the associated hydrocephalus.
•In patients with untreated hydrocephalus or diffuse cerebral edema, management of
elevated intracranial pressure should proceed anthelminthic treatment .
8.1.5 Viral infections 
Viral infections of the nervou s system are mainly caused by Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). ( Refer to section on viral infections and HIV) 
Herpes simplex encephalitis  
Most of cases in adults are caused by HSV -1, a small number are caused by HSV -2 usually in 
immunosuppressed states or in neonates. It should be suspected in all patients not responding to 
antibiotics/other treatments.  
Clinical presentation  
• Early features are fever, headache & altered consciousness which may develop gradually
over days or rapidly over hours
• The most common manifestations are personality change, dysphasia, behaviouraldisturbance, and occasional psychotic features
• Focal or generalized seizures
Investigations

8.2 Initial Management of Stroke 
8.2.1 Management of Acut e Hemorrhagi c Stroke 
Spontaneous, nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains a significant cause of morbidity 
and mortality  throughout  the world.  However,  population -based  studies  indicate  that  most  ICHs  in 
most patients are survivable with good medical care th us emphasizing the importance of improved 
clinical care. in determining ICH outcome.  
Clinical presentation  
• Severe headache, vomiting,
• Focal neurological deficits• decreased level of consciousness
that may progress to coma
• symptom progression over minute s
or hour
Investigations 
• Rapid neuroimaging: plain CT to distinguish ischemic stroke from ICH
• MRI with angiography- useful to evaluate for underlying structural lesions e.g., vascular
malformations and tumors in suspicious cases
Admit all patients with I CH in an ICUor dedicat ed str oke unit for initia l managemen t and 
monitoring. 
Pharmacological Treatment 
For elevat ed SBP (150 -220mmHg), initiat e BP loweri ng treatment, target at 140mmHg. Consider 
more aggressive reduction if SBP>220mmHg. 
C: labetalol (IV) a t 1mg/min u ntil target SBP is a ttained. 
Anticoagulation -related ICH: withhold anticoagulants and correct INR, if elevated, start on vitamin K 
and consider FFP transfusion 
B: phytomenadi one (vitami n K) (IV) 1m g slow infusi on over 60 minutes 
If increased I CP based on clinic radiological features, give 
C: mannitol (IV bolus) 0.25 -1gm/k g 4-6hourl y for 24 -72hours 
OR 
C: hypertonic saline 3% (IV bolus) at 3 -5ml/kg 4- 6hourly for 24 -72hours  
Monitor serum osmolarity and renal function when giving Mannitol or Hyp ertonic saline, stop if 
osmolarity goes >320mOsm/L 
Treat fever with antipyretic medications and/or external cooling methods  
D: paracetamol (IV) 1g 8hourly for 3 -5days then when required 
Perform regular monitoring and control of blood glucose to prevent b oth hyperglycemia and 
hypoglycemia.  
Treat clinical or electrographic seizures associated with decreased loss of consciousness   
S: levetiracetam (PO/IV) 500mg 12hourly for 2weeks  
C: phenytoin (IV) 15mg/kg loading dose over 30min, then maintenance at 100mg 8hourly 
for 2weeks.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Apply compressive stockings or intermittent pneumatic compression at admission to
prevent VTE
• LMWH can be started later after cessation of bleeding in immobile patients.
• Consider systemic anticoagulation or IVC filter only in patients with symptomatic deep
vein thrombosis or Pulmonary embolism.149		Surgical management • Consider neurosurgical evaluation for External Ventricular drainage (EVD) in patients with decreased level of consciousness from resultant hydrocephalus in the setting of intraventricular hemorrhage. • Refer for surgical evacuation of hematoma as soon as possible in patients with cerebellar hemorrhage who are deteriorating neurologically or who have brainstem compression and/or hydrocephalus from ventricular obstruction  • For supratentorial hematomas, consider evacuation in deteriorating patients with or without decompressive craniectomy as a life-saving measure in selected cases, based on expert neurosurgical clinical judgement. • Consider minimally invasive clot evacuation via stereotactic or endoscopic aspiration with or without thrombolytic usage, based on expert clinical judgement and available resources.   8.2.2 Initial Management of Acute Subarachnoid Hemorrhage from Ruptured Cerebral Aneurysm Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) refers to presence of blood in the fluid-filled subarachnoid spaces around the brain and spinal cord. The most common presentation is sudden onset of severe novel headache. SAH from ruptured cerebral aneurysms is associated with high mortality and morbidity hence clinician’s high index of suspicion and proper initial management is crucial for patient’s survival and improved functional outcome.   Clinical presentation • Severe headache (worst headache of life) • Altered mental status that may progress to coma • Focal neurological deficits • Seizures Laboratory Investigations • CBC, PT/PTT/INR • Serial ABGs, electrolytes  • serum and urine osmolality    Imaging investigations • CT angiography • Four vessel catheter angiography/digital subtraction angiography (DSA) o Perform 4-vessel catheter angiography to determine source of bleeding  o The timing of study takes into consideration the patient’s condition (unstable or premorbid patients are not candidates), the feasibility of early treatment, the likelihood of endovascular therapy (based on patient’s age and predicted aneurysm location as well as availability of required resources and expertise) • CXR—monitor for pulmonary edema if in hyperdynamic therapy  Principles of initial management of aneurysmal SAH are focused on  • Initial hemodynamic stabilization and life support of the patient • Prevention of rebleeding through timely coiling or surgical clipping • Prevention, identification, and early management of hydrocephalus  • Prevention and management of delayed ischemic neurologic deficit (DIND) from vasospasm   Admitting orders • Admit all aneurysmal SAH patients to ICU regardless of their initial GCS score • Document initial Hunt & Hess, WFNS clinical scores, and Fisher CT scan score • Bedrest with head of bed elevation at 30°.  • Initiate SAH precautions (low level of external stimulation, restricted visitation, dim light, no loud noises) • Check neurological status every 1 hour. • Bed pan, indwelling Foley catheter if patient is lethargic, incontinent with strict Inputs & outputs measurements. • Keep Nil per Oral (if in preparation for surgery or endovascular intervention) 150		• Maintain SBP 120–160mmHg in unsecured (unclipped/uncoiled) aneurysm to minimise rebleeding risk, consider  D: labetalol (IV) 1mg/min until target SBP is attained.  • IV fluids: 0.9% NS + 20 mEq KCl/L at 2 ml/kg/hour maintenance fluid  Prophylactic anticonvulsants:  S: levetiracetam (PO/IV) 500mg 12 hourly while aneurysm is unsecured, continue for 1week post clipping/endovascular intervention  OR C: phenytoin (IV) 15mg/kg loading dose at 50mg/min rate then 100mg 8hourly for 2-4 weeks  Sedation (not over sedation):  D: propofol (IV) (for intubated patients) at 25-75mcg/kg/minute  Give  B: dexamethasone (IV) 4mg 6 hourly for 3-5days to reduce neck pain  AND S: fentanyl (IV) 25–100mcg (0.5–2 ml) every 1–2hours when required in ICU.  Stool softener: Initiate  C: lactulose (PO) 30mls 8hourly until aneurysm is secured.  Anti-emetics:  D: ondansetron (IV) 4mg over 2–5minutes, may repeat 8hourly for 1–2days.   Prevention of vasospasm: Initiate  S: nimodipine (PO/NGT) 60mg 4hourly, continue for 21days   Stress ulcer prophylaxis: C: pantoprazole (IV) 40mg 24hourly for 1-2weeks   Oxygenation goals (for intubated ventilated patients) o pO2 > 100mm Hg, O2 saturation 100% in patients at risk for vasospasm, aim for 92% saturation in all others.  o To achieve above goals, increase FiO2 and mean airway pressure (PEEP) in ventilated patients o in non-intubated patient: Give O2 2L per nasal cannula PRN (based on ABG)  • Strive for normocarbia, avoid prophylactic hyperventilation  • Avoid arterial hyperoxia (paO2 > 300mm Hg)- to avoid risk of vasoconstriction • maintain normothermia and encourage other cooling measures to reduce and prevent fever. D: paracetamol (IV) 1g 8hourly for 3-5days then when required • Hemoglobin and hematocrit: Transfuse whole or PRBC when Hct drops < 40%) • Monitor serum glucose and maintain normoglycemia   Surgical management Refer to a centre that can handle neurovascular cases for prompt neurosurgical evaluation and subsequent surgical clipping or endovascular intervention (coiling or embolization) to secure the ruptured cerebral aneurysm.   8.2.3 Initial management of Acute Ischemic Stroke Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of adult disability in the developed world.In AIS, a thrombus impairs cerebral blood flow, resulting in brain tissue infarction. Collateral blood flow gives rise to an area of hypoperfused tissue (ischemic penumbra) that is at risk of infarction if hypoperfusion persists. Prompt reopening of an occluded blood vessel to re-establish blood flow to the ischemic area (reperfusion) in eligible patients, can rescue the ischemic penumbra from death and spare the patient from serious long term disabilities.    151	Clinical presentation  
• Severe headache
• Focal neurological deficits
• decreased level of consciousness
that may progress to coma• seizures
• symptom progression over minute s
or hours
Investigations  
• FBP, PT/PTT/INR,
• Random blood glucose
• serial ABGs, serum electrolytes
• Non contrast CT scan to dist inguish
AIS from ICH• CT angiogram in potential
candidates for reperfusion
• CT/MR perfusion studies
• MR angiography (MRA) with
• DWI for selected patients. (contraindicated with cardiac pacemakers, metal implants)
• Four-vessel catheter angiography
• Baseline ECG and ECHO
Prehospital and lower level health facilities  
• Provide initial airway management and hemodynamic stabilization
• Exclude stroke mimics like hypoglycemia
• International stroke guidelines recommend rapid identification of all fibrinolytic -eligible and
mechanical thrombectomy -eligible patients to facilitate initiation of treatment in the fastest
achievable onset -to-treatment time
• Consider prompt referral to a centre that can handle stroke patients including rapidneuroimaging and administration of reperf usion therapy.
Referral hospital and specialized centres  
• Provide initial stabilization of the patient as per ABCDE protocol
• Perform rapid careful neurological examination.
• Order emergency brain imaging evaluation before initiating any stroke specific trea tments.
• Screen for reperfusion eligible patients and initiate appropriate treatment protocol.
• In patients with AIS who awake with stroke symptoms or have unclear time of onset > 4.5hours from last -known- well (LKW) state, perform brain MRI to identify diff usion- positive,
FLAIR -negative lesions to aid selecting those who can benefit from IV alteplas
e
administration.
• In potential candidates for mechanical thrombectomy, consider imaging of the extracrania l
carotid and vertebral arteries, in addition to the int racranial circulation, to provide useful
information on patient eligibility and endovascular procedural planning.
Reperfusion criteria: all must be met 
• Onset of stroke or Last known well (LKW) state <4.5hours
• No increased bleeding risk contraindications
• Blood pressure controlled to <185/105mmHg target.
• Non contrast brain CT has excluded intracranial hemorrhage and/or
• established a hypodense zone or hyperdense vessel sign.
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Oxygenation —support airway, maintain O2 saturation > 94%
• Monitor BP, if elevated, initiate BP lowering treatment to target BP<185/110 mmHg
• For patients who are non -eligible for fibrinolysis aim to lower BP by 15% in the first 24
hours
• Monitor body temperature and initiate treatment when >38°C
• In immobile st roke patients without contraindications, offer compressive stockings, o r
pneumatic compression devices for DVT prophylaxis.
• Start on enteral diet (PO/NGT) within 7days of admission after AIS.152	Pharmacological treatment  
A: acetylsalicylic acid (PO) 325 mg 24hourly for 4weeks  
AND 
C: labetalol (IV) 10 -20mg infusion 1- 2min, repeated until target BP is attained. 
AND 
D: paracetamol (IV) 1g 8hourly for 3 -5days then when required.  
Note  
For those treated with alteplase, acetylsalicylic acid administration should be delayed until 24 hours 
later 
For seizure control 
C: phenytoin (IV) 15mg/kg loading dose over 30min, then 100mg 8hourly for 4weeks. 
OR 
S: levetiracetam (PO/IV) 500mg 12hourly for 2 -4 weeks 
• Initiate statins in eligible patients and continue st atins in patients already taking statins at
the time of onset of AIS.
Reperfusion treatment:  
In patients qualified for intravenous thrombolysis, benefit of therapy is time dependent, and 
treatment should be initiated as quickly as possible . 
Admit the pat ient to an ICU or designated stroke unit  for monitoring and initiate,  
         S:  alteplase (IV) 0.9mg/kg maximum dose 90mg (given over 60minutes with initial 10% of dose 
given as bolus over 1 minute)

A: adrenaline (S/C) (0.1%) 0.3 mL or by nebulizer 0.5 mL stat 
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
Mechanical thrombectomy 
• Consider for selected patients who present between 6 and 16 hours  of LKW with an
anterior -circulation large -vessel occlusion (ICA or proximal MCA) and meet other
specified eligibility criteria based on expert assessment, clinical judg ement, and availability
of required resources.153	• Consider decompressive craniectomy in patients ≤60 years of age who deteriorate
neurologically within 48 hours from brain swelling associated with unilateral MCA
infarctions despit e appropriate medical therapy.
• Consider external ventricular drainage (EVD) in the treatment of obstructive
hydrocephalus following cerebellar infarction.
• Emergency carotid end arterectomy (CEA) in the acute stage is not well established hence
not recom mended  in initial management of AIS.
8.3 Management of Epilepsy  
Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterised by recurring seizures.  About two -thirds of 
people with active epilepsy have their epilepsy controlled satisfactorily with anti -epileptic drugs 
(AEDs). Other treatment approaches may include surgery and neuromodulation. Optimal 
management is required to improve patient’s health outcomes and minimise detrimental impacts on social, educational, and occupational activities.  
Clinical presentation Recurrent seizures  
Investigations  
• Serum electrolytes
• Serum antiepileptic drug levels
• Electroencephalogram (EEG)
• Brain CT scan
• Brain MRI with epilepsy protocol
Classification of epileptic syndromes  
Classify epileptic seizures and epilepsy syndrome s in all patients using a multi -axial diagnostic 
scheme (refer to ILAE classification) as failure to classify the epilepsy syndrome correctly can lead to inappropriate treatment and persistence of seizures.  
Pharmacological management  
• Utilize a single AED (monotherapy) and increase dose until seizures are controlled or side
effects cannot be tolerated.
• If the initial treatment is unsuccessful, initiate alternative monotherapy with different drugs
before resorting to drug combinations.
• Combination therapy ( adjunctive or 'add -on' therapy) should only be considered w hen
attempts at monotherapy with AEDs have not resulted in seizure freedom.
• If trials of combination therapy do not bring about worthwhile benefits, revert treatment to
the initial monotherapy reg imen that has proved most acceptable to the patient and
consider referral for expert evaluation.
For management of status epilepticus —refer to emergency and critical care chapter  
I. Focal seizures

9.2 Obstructive Lung Diseases  
It’s a chronic airway disease which result in airway flow limitation can be either reversible or 
irreversible  
 Clinical presentation  
• Wheezing
• Difficulty in breath ing or shortness
of breath
• Chest tightness• Cough (dry or productive cough)
• Finger clubbing
9.2.1 Asthma It is a chronic reversible obstructive inflammatory airways disease in which many cells and cellular 
element play a role by constriction of bronchial smooth muscle causing bronchospasm,  oedema  of 
bronchial mucous membrane and blockage of the smaller bronchi with plug of mucous. 
Clinical presentation  
• wheeze,
• shortness of breath,
• chest tightne ss
• co
ugh This presentation particularly
at night or in the  ear ly morning
• Tachypnea,• Tachycardia,
• Diffuse musical wheezes,
• Prolonged phase of exhalation,
• Chest hyperinflation.
• Use of Accessory muscle.
Investigations  
• FBP (Look for eosinophilia)
• Serum IgEa
• ESR
• ABG
• CXR if highly suspicion of
pneumonia
• Sputum for cytology a (look for
eosinophilia),
• Lung function Test (e.g.: spirometrywith reversibility test, PEFR 
measurement with a peak flow 
meter), Exhaled NO should be done to asses evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation  
aVery important test to establish diagnosis of asthma 
Non-p harmacological Treatment  
• Avoid polluted environment (both
indoors and outdoors)
• Avoid non-selective β-blockers,
which can trigger asthmatic attack
• Avoid heavy exercise• Stop smoking
• Avoid both overweight andunderweight
Note  
• The management of asthma in children is like that in adult. Infants under 18 months, may not
respond well in bronchodilator
• Uncertain in diagnosis should prompt early referral, because asthma -COPD overlap has worse
outcome.
• Patient intolerant of NSAIDs or who exhibit any of the high- risk clinical features for intolerance to
these drugs (severe asthma, nasal polyps or ch ronic rhino sinusitis) should use NSAIDs only
under close medical supervision.167	Table 9.5: Assessment and Treatment of Asthma attack in Children ≥2years & Adults

Patient with life threatening asthma should be managed in HDU/ICU.  Note Patients who get night attacks should be advised to take their medication on going to bed  9.2.2 Chronic Asthma in Adults The assessment of the frequency of daytime and nighttime symptoms and limitation of physical activity determines whether asthma is intermittent or persistent. There are 4 categories (see table 9.5) Therapy is stepwise (Step 1–4) based on the category of asthma and consists of: • Preventing the inflammation leading to bronchospasm (controllers) • Relieving bronchospasm (relievers)  Controller medicines in asthma • Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) e.g. Beclomethasone, Budesonide, Fluticasone • Leukotriene modifiers: e.g. Montelukast can added from step 2 patient (should be administer when low ICS or ICS-LABA has failed to achieve desired outcome. • long acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) e.g tiotropium • Long acting β2 agonists (LABA) e.g. formoterol, salmeterol  Reliever medicines in asthma • Short acting β2 agonists (SABA) e.g. Salbutamol • short acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) e.g. ipratropium bromide (should be used in acute asthma attack)  Note • In specialized centre when low dose ICS alone fails to achieve good control for difficult to treat and severe asthma, the addition of LABA + ICS should be instituted.  • The most common side effects of inhaled steroids are a sore throat, hoarseness of voice, and infections/fungal infections in the throat and mouth.  Things you can do to avoid or reduce these side effects include: • Rinsing your mouth and gargling after taking an inhaled steroid • Using a spacer/holding chamber to reduce the amount of steroid landing in your mouth and throat (For children and elderly patient)       169		Table 9.6: Long-Term Treatment of Asthma According to Severity Categories Treatment STEP 1 Intermittent asthma • Intermittent symptoms < once/week • Nighttime symptoms < twice/ month • Normal physical activity A: As needed low dose ICS OR  S: ICS AND LABA  B: budesonide (inhalation) 100-200µg 12hourly                  OR  B: budesonide (inhalation) 100-200µg 12hourly                  AND C: salmeterol 100- 200mcg 2puff   12hourly                  OR Low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken STEP 2 Mild persistent asthma • Symptoms > once/ week but < once/ day • Nighttime symptoms > twice/ month • Symptoms may affect activity Daily low dose ICS plus as needed SABA                  OR  As needed low dose ICS+ salmeterol                   OR Low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken ICS  Add: - LTRA;  D: montelukast (PO) 4mg nocte (6month to 6years) or > 6years to 15years (PO) 5mg nocte or >15years (PO) 10mg nocte (for period not less than 3/12) STEP 3 Moderate persistent asthma • Daily symptoms • Symptoms affect activity • Nighttime symptoms >once/ week • Daily use of Salbutamol Refer these patients to physician/ respiratory physician/ pulmonologist low dose ICS+LABA            OR Medium dose ICS            OR  Low dose ICS +LTRA  LTRA; D: montelukast (PO) 4mg nocte (6month to 6years) or (PO) 5mg nocte > 6-15years or (PO) 10mg nocte >15years (for period not less than 3/12) STEP 4 Severe persistent asthma • Daily symptoms • Frequent nighttime symptoms • Physical activity limited by symptoms Refer this patient to Respiratory physician/Pulmonologist Medium dose ICS+LABA             OR High dose ICS Add  S**: tiotropium Mist (inhalation) 6mcg 2puff 24hourly              OR Add on LTRA D: montelukast (PO) 4mg nocte (6month to 6years) or (PO) 5mg nocte >6years to 15years or (PO) 10mg nocte>15years (for period not less than 3/12) Add: S: tiotropium mist inhaler 6mcg 2puff 24hourly           OR  S: ipratropium Bromide (Inhalation) 40 mcg 2puff 12hourly For patient with rhinitis and asthma add sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) provided FEV1>70% predicted STEP 5 Severe asthma • Symptoms throughout the day • Night symptoms seven times per weeks • Physical activity extreme limited by symptoms Refer to expert opinion (respiratory physician/pulmonologist for phenotypic investigation+/- add on treatment  High dose ICS-LABA Low dose OCS but consider side effects S: tiotropium (inhalation) as step 4 Biologics as indicated  S: omalizumab (SC) 75-600mg every 2-4weeks;      170		Table 9.7 Low, Medium and High Dose Inhaled Corticosteroids Adults and Adolescents (≥12 Years) Inhaled corticosteroid Total daily dose (mcg) Low Medium High Budesonide (DPI) 200-400 >400-800 >800 Fluticasone propionate (DPI OR HFA) 100-250 >250-500 >500 Mometasone furoate 110-220 >220-440 >440 Triamcinolone acetonide 400-1000 >1000-2000 >2000  DPI: Dry powder inhaler, HFA: hydrofluoroalkane, CFC: Chlorofluorocarbon propellant (included for comparison),   Table 9.8 Low, Medium and High Dose Inhaled Corticosteroids Children 6–11 Years Inhaled corticosteroid Total daily dose (mcg) Low  Medium High Budesonide (DPI) 100-200 >200-400 >400 Budesonide (nebules) 250-500 >500-1000 >1000 Fluticasone propionate (DPI) 100-200 >200-400 >400 Fluticasone propionate (HFA) 100-200 >200-500 >500 Momentansone furoate 110 >220-≤440 ≥440 Triamcinolone acetonide 400-800 >800-1200 >1200  9.3 Bronchitis 9.3.1 Acute Bronchitis Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute self-limited lower respiratory tract infection manifested predominantly by cough with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks with no clinical or any recent radiographic evidence to suggest an alternative explanation.In acute bronchitis some isolated virus (influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus) and bacteria (Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumonia)  Clinical presentation • Patients with acute bronchitis present with a cough lasting more than five days (typically one to three weeks), which may be associated with sputum production.  • Cough in the absence of fever, tachycardia, and tachypnoea suggests bronchitis, • Acute bronchitis should be distinguished from chronic bronchitis (see below), it is not a form of COPD  Note When the acute bronchitis persists or worsens, we suggest that the patient is advised to seek reassessment and do below   targeted investigation(s).  Investigation in COPD (bronchitis and Emphysema) • FBP • ESR /CRP OR Procalcitonin • Serum alpha-1 antitrypsin levels • Chest radiography (if the patient is elderly or physical findings   suggest pneumonia) • Sputum cytology (if the cough is persistent) • Blood culture and microbial sensitivity (if bacterial super-infection is suspected) • Bronchoscopy (to exclude foreign body aspiration, tuberculosis, tumours, and other chronic diseases and patient with worsening symptoms) • Lung function Test (Spirometry and Peak expiratory flow rate)  Note An exception, however, is cough in elderly patients; pneumonia in elderly patients is often characterized by an absence of distinctive signs and symptoms.    171	Symptomatic Treatment 
• With non -steroidal anti -inflammatory dru gs: paracetamol, acetyl salicylic aci d
• Cough management refer section 9.1.1
• There is NO benefit from antibiotic use in acute bronchitis.
• Discourage smoking and other irritating factors.
9.3.2 Chronic Bronchitis  
It defined by a chronic productive cough fo r three months in each of two successive years in a 
patient in whom other causes of chronic cough have been excluded. Patients may get secondary 
bacterial infection with development of fever and production of thick smelly sputum.  
Table 9.9: Risk Factor for Chronic Bronchitis  
Risk factor  
1. Cigarette smoking
2. Indoor air pollution
>Exposure from burning wood >Exposure to biofuel mass exposure
>Heating in poorly vented dwellings
3. Occupational exposure

>Livestock farming (i.e. to pesticides)
4. Exposure to agricultural
5. Use of domestic solid fuel
Investigation 
As in acute bronchitis 
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Stop smoking (Reducing loss of lung function) and/or remove from hazardous envir onment
• Prompt treatment of infective exacerbations
• Controlled oxygen therapy
• Physiotherapy
• Pulmonary Rehabilitation (consist of education, lifestyle modification, regular physical
activities, physiotherapy and avoid indoor and outdoor pollutants)
• Nutritio n support
• BIPAP in specialized center
• Influenza vaccine in specialized center
Pharmacological Treatment  
• Pharmacologic therapy for Chronic Bronchitis is directed towards 3 major goals
• Relieving symptoms during stable disease
Mucoactive Agents -Reduced ove rproduction and hypersecretion, increases elimination  
For pharmaceutical management; refer  to emergency and critical care chapter  
Hypertonic saline- stimulate productive cough and decreases sputum viscoelasticity, increases 
mucociliary clearance.

Macrolides - (As indicated) antibacterial effects; Immune -modulatory and anti -inflammatory effects 
(Azithromycin/clarithromycin)  
Note  
• In specialized center they may use N -acetyl cysteine and carbocysteine as mucolytic agents
• Macrolide should be given in consultation with respiratory physician/Pulmonologist to avoid
antimicrobial resistance (Azithr omycin and clarithromycin may be used).
Avoid use of systemic glucocorticoids due to numerous adverse side effects 
9.4 Emphysema  
It is a destructive process in the gas -exchanging air spaces of the lung that results in perforations, 
obliteration of airsp ace walls, and coalescence of small distinct airspaces into much larger ones, 
leading to enlargement of the gas exchanging units of the lungs These changes cause loss of elastic 
recoil of the lungs and abnormal gas exchange.  
 Clinical presentation  
• Shortn ess of breath
• Cough , sometimes caused by the
production of mucus
• Wheezing
• Slow and prolonged expiration
• Chest wall hyperinflation,
• Limited diaphragmatic motion on
auscultation,
• Distant br eath sounds, and heart
sounds• Coarse early inspiratory crackles.
• Use of accessory muscles
• Pursed -lip breathing
• Signs of cor pulmonale. (Raised
JVP, peripheral oedema,
hepatomegaly etc)
• Cyanosis
• Asterixis
Investigations  
• Haematocrit(men>52% and 
>47men) Or FBP ( look a t
haematocrit)
• ABG(look for bicarbonate -metabolic
alkalosis)
• CXR• Sputum culture and Microbialsensitivity
• Pulmonary function tests
• Six minutes’ walk test
• CT SCAN OF THE CHEST/HRCT
(for evaluation for Lung Volume
Reduction Surgery)
Non-pharmacological Treatment: 
• Stop smoking
• Give oxygen after evaluation
Pharmacological Treatment  
Inhaled bronchodilators relax and open the airways. They may be short -acting (albuterol, 
ipratropium) or long -acting (salmeterol, tiotropium,). These medicines may be available as inhalers 
("puffers") or as a solution. A nebulizer machine aerosolizes the bronchodilator solution, which is 
then breathed through a tube.  For more detail refer Treatment in section 9.2 above

9.6 Other Respiratory Infections 
9.6.1 Acute Laryngo-Tracheobronchitis 
Laryngo- tracheobronchitis  (croup)  is acute  inflammation  of the larynx,  trachea  and  bronchi  which 
occurs  in young children  (usually  between  6 months  to 3 years  of age).  It arises  as a result  of 
narrowing  of the airway  in the region  of the lary nx. The most  common  cause  is viral  infection 
(particularly parainfluenza viruses) but may also be due to bacterial infection. The obstruction is d ue 
to inflammation and  oedema . 
Clinical presentation 
• The symptoms include paroxysmal “barking” cough, inspiratory stridor, fever, wheezing,
hoarseness of voice and tachypnoea
• Such symptoms usually occur at night
• Respiratory failure and pneumonia are potentially fatal complications.
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Prevent asphyxiation
• Treat inflammatory oedema
• Humidification of inhaled air
• Hospitalization may be necessary174	Note  
•No stridor at rest, give no antibiotics
•Stridor at rest or chest in- drawing or fast breathing REFER IMMEDIATELY to hospital
Mild Croup  
• Only stridor when upset, no
moderate/severe ARI
• Likely of viral origin• Home care – steam inhalation
• Antibiotics NOT required
Severe Croup  
• Likely bacterial origi n
• Stridor in a calm child at r est
• Chest in drawing• Antibiotics are NOT effective andshould not be given
Pharmacological Treatment  
Admit to hospital, give Oxygen therapy to all patients with chest in -drawing (using nasal prongs only, 
DO NOT use nasopharyngeal or nasal catheter) un til the lower chest wall in- drawing is no longer 
present  
D: dexamethasone (PO) 0.6mg/kg 24hourly in 1 –2 divided doses  
AND 
A: adrenaline (inhalation) 400mcg/kg 2hourly if effective; repeat after 30min if necessary . 
9.6.2 Laryngeal Diphtheria 
Is an infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria ; it is directly transmitted from person to person 
by droplets.  Children  between  1–5 years  of age are  most  susceptible  although  non-immune  adults 
are also  at risk.   Diphtheria  is characterized  by grayish -white  membr ane, composed  of dead cells, 
fibrin, leucocytes and red blood cells as a result of inflammation due to multiplying bacteria.

responding to treatment.182	9.6.14 Respirat ory Failure  
Respiratory failure is a clinical condition that happens when the respiratory system fails to maintain 
its main function, which is gas exchange, in which PaO2 lower than 60 mmHg and/or PaCO2 higher than 50 mmHg. Respiratory failure is classifie d according to blood gases abnormalities into type 1 
and type 2.  
Hypoxemic respiratory failure  (type I): has a PaO2 < 60 mmHg with normal or subnormal PaCO2. 
In this type, the gas exchange is impaired at the level of alveoli -capillary membrane. Examples of  
type I respiratory failures are carcinogenic or non -cardiogenic pulmonary edema and severe 
pneumonia.  
Hypercapnic respiratory failure  (type II): has a PaCO2 > 50 mmHg. Hypoxemia is common, and it 
is due to respiratory pump failure

Shigella organisms are a group of gram- negative, facultative intracellular bacteria pathogens. They 
are grouped into 4 species: Shigella dysenteriae , Shigella flexneri , Shigella boydii , and Shigella  
sonnei , also known as groups A, B, C, and D respectively. Shigellosis is spread by means of fecal -
oral, by ingestion by ingestion of contaminated food or water and leads to bacillary dysentery.  Note  
Definitive treatment of typho id (enteric fever) is based on susceptibility. For patients with severe or 
complicated disease (e.g. systemic toxicity, depressed consciousness, prolonged fever, organ 
system dysfunction or other features that prompt hospitalization), initial therapy with a parenteral 
agent is appropriate.  188	Clinical presentation

10.2.3 Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding  
Intraluminal blood loss anywhere from the oropharynx to the anus. Classification: upper = above the ligament of Trei tz; lower = below the ligament of Treitz “Severe” GIB: defined as having associated 
shock, orthostatic hypotension, fall in hematocrit by 6% (or decrease in Hb by 2 g/dL), or requiring transfusion ≥ 2U PRBCs. Requires hospitalization.  192	10.2.3.1 Upper GI Ble eding (UGIB) 
PUD caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or NSAID use is the most common cause of nonvariceal 
UGI bleeding. Characteristic findings are hematemesis, melena, or (infrequently) bright -red blood 
per rectum or a high serum BUN/creatinine ratio. Slow and/or chronic bleeding is suggested by iron 
deficiency and is typical of erosive disease, tumor, esophageal ulcer, portal hypertensive 
gastropathy, Cameron lesion (erosions found within large hiatal hernias), and angiodysplasia.  
Table 10.1: Differen tial Diagnosis of Upper GI Bleeding  
Presentation Diagnosis 
Dyspepsia, H. pylori infection, NSAID use, 
anticoagulation, severe medical illness  Peptic ulcer disease 
Stigmata of chronic liver disease, evidence of portal 
hypertension or risk factors for cirr hosis (alcohol 
use, viral hepatitis)   Variceal bleeding  
History of heavy alcohol use and retching before 
hematemesis, hematemesis following weightlifting, 
or young woman with bulimia   Mallory -Weiss tear  
Heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia; usually 
small-volume or occult bleeding   Esophagitis  
Progressive dysphagia, weight loss, early satiety, 
or abdominal pain; usually small -volume or occult 
bleeding  Esophageal or gastric cancer  
NSAID use, heavy alcohol intake, severe medical 
illness; usually small -volume or occult bleeding  Gastroduodenal erosions  
Initial management 
Assess severity: vital si gns includi ng orthos tatic changes , JVP. Tachycardi a (can be m asked by β B 
use) suggests 10% volum e loss, orthostatic hy potensi on 20% loss, shock >30% loss. After the 
patient is stabilized, upper endosc opy is requir ed to document t he sourc e of bleed ing. If upper 
endosc opy shows an ulcer, test for H. pylori infection.  
Resuscitation: placement of 2 large- bore (18- gauge or larger) intravenous lines, volume 
replacement: NS or LR to achieve normal vital s igns, urine output, and mental s tatus. 
Pharmacological Treatment  
For variceal bleedi ng refer t o (10.4.2. 3 Bleedi ng Esophageal Varices) 
For bleedi ng peptic ulcer disease 
C: pantoprazole (IV) 40mg 12hourly for 2 -3days 
OR 
S: esomeprazole (IV) 40mg 12hourly for 2 -3days  
Laboratory Investigations 
• FBP, LFT, RFT.
• Abdominal ultrasound• Viral hepatitis screening
• H. pylori stool antigen
10.2.3.2 Lower gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding 
Acute, painless LGI bleeding in older adult patients is usually due  to colonic diverticula or 
angiodysplasia. Ten percent of rapid rectal bleeding has an UGI source.  
Consider outpatient follow -up or early discharge when:  Note  
• Treat high -risk ulcers endoscop ically (haemoclips, thermal therapy, or injection therapy)
and continuous IV PPI infusion for 72 hours . Blood transfusion to target haemoglobin level
of 7 g/dl  Repeat endoscopic therapy for continued bleeding
• Surgery or interventional radiology if endoscop ic therapy unsuccessful193	• patient age <60 years
• no hemodynamic instability
• no evidence of gross rectal bleeding
• identification o f an obvious anorectal source of bleeding
Table 10.2: Differential Diagnosis of Lower GI Bleeding  
Note  
• According to expert opinion, the blood transfusion threshold for patients with colonic bleeding is a
haemoglobin value <9 g/dL (note this is diffe rent for the evidence -based threshold for UGI bleeding).
• If the patient is hemodynamically unstable, resuscitate the patient before diagnostic studies are
performed. Most episodes of LGI bleeding resolve spontaneously.
• Colonoscopy is recommended early, u sually within the first 48 hours of admission, and endoscopi c
therapy is used to control continued bleeding .
• If colonoscopy does not identify a discrete lesion or endoscopic therapy does not control the bleeding ,
interventional angiography or surgery may be indicated.
• Patients with angiodysplasia in the setting of AS (Heyde Syndrome) may benefit from valve
replacement surgery.
10.2.3.3 Bleeding of Obscure Origin 
Obscure GI bleeding is recurrent blood loss without an identified source of bleeding desp ite upper 
endoscopy and colonoscopy.Patients aged ≤50 years are more likely to have tumors (leiomyomas, 
carcinoid, adenocarcinoma, or lymphoma), Dieulafoylesion, or Crohn’s disease. Older patients are 
more likely to have vascular lesions, such as angiodysp lasia. Angiodysplasia is the most common 
cause of obscure GI bleeding overall (40% of all cases). Patients may present with either melena or 
hematochezia or positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT). The first step is to repeat upper endoscopy 
and/or colonoscopy, which is diagnostic in approximately 40% of cases.  
For patients with obscure activeGI bleeding  
• nuclear studies (technetium 99m -labeled erythrocyte or sulfur colloid nuclear scan) firs t,
followed by angiography
• if unrevealing, consider push enteros copy or balloon -assisted enteroscopy ( deep
enteroscopy)Presentation Diagnosis 
Painless, self -limited, massive hematochezia  Diverticular bleeding (most common overall cause) 
Chronic blood loss or acute painless hematochezia 
in an older adult patient  Angiodysplasia  
Stool positive for occult blood in an asymptomatic 
patient  Colonic polyp or cancer  
Risk factors for atherosclerosis and evidence of 
vascular disease in an older adult patient; typically, 
with LLQ abdominal pain  Ischemic colitis 
Aortic stenosis  Angiodyspla sia (Heyde Syndrome)  
History of bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, abdominal 
pain, fever  IBD 
Rapid UGI bleeding  Dieulafoy lesion (large, tortuous, submucosal 
arteriole)  
Large hiatal hernia  Cameron lesion (mucosal erosions)  
Recent liver or biliary procedure Hem obilia  
Necrotizing pancreatitis Hemosuccus pancreaticus (bleeding from 
pancreas)  
Aortic aneurysm repair  Aortoenteric fistula  
Painless hematochezia in a young patient and 
normal upper endoscopy and colonoscopy  Meckel diverticulum  
Mucocutaneous telangie ctasias Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia  194	• surgery and intraoperative enteroscopy is a last diagnostic option
For patients with occult GI bleeding  
• capsule endoscopy (first choice GIE 2015; 81:889) or deep enteroscopy
• if unrevealing, repeat e ndoscopic examinations (upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, capsul e
endoscopy), or deep enteroscopy
10.3 Diseases of the Intestine 
10.3.1 Inflammatory Bowel Diseases 
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an idiopathic disease involving an immune reaction of the bo dy 
to its own intestinal tract. The 2 major types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease 
(CD). Pathologically, ulcerative colitis is limited to the colon while Crohn’s disease can involve any 
segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the mouth to the anus.

10.3.3 Radiation Proctitis  
Radiation proctopathy is defined as epithelial damage to the rectum due to radiation that is 
associated with minimal or no inflammation. Acute radiation proctitis occurs during or within six weeks of radiation therapy. Chronic radiation proctitis has a more delayed onset. The first symptoms 
often occur 9 to 14 months following radiation exposure but can occur any time post -irradiation up to 
30 years after exposure.  
Clinical presentation  
• Symptoms of acute radiation proctitis include diarrhea, mucus discharge, urgency,
tenesmus, and, uncommonly, bleeding.
• Patients with chronic radiation proctitis have similar symptoms as patients with acut e
radiation proctitis, but bleeding is usually more severe. In addition, patients may have
symptoms of obstructed defecation due to strictures with constipation, rectal pai n, urgency,
and, rarely, fecal incontinence due to overflow.
• Concomitant injury to the genitourinary tract or small bowel may lead to fistulas, smallbowel obstruction, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, urethral stenosis, and cystitis
• Acute radiation proctitis should be suspected in patients with diarrhea, mucus discharge,
urgency, tenesmus, or bleeding during or within six weeks of radiation therapy. Chronic
radiation proctitis should be suspected in patients who develop these symptoms nine
months or more after pelvic radiation exposure.
Investigations

10.4   Disorders of The Liver and Biliary Tract  
10.4.1 Hepatitis 
This is the term referring to inflammation of the liver, which may result from various causes, both 
infectious (i.e. viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic organisms) and non -infectious e.g.  alcohol, 
drugs,  autoimmune and metabolic diseases; this section focuses on viral hepatitis and its sequels.  
10.4.1.1 Viral Hepatitis 
It is a systemic infection predominantly affecting the liver caused hepatotropic viral agents namely 
Hepat itis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), HBV – associated delta 
agent or Hepatitis D virus (HDV), and Hepatitis E virus (HEV); in most cases leads to a self -limiting 
disease but can take a fulminant course and lead to hepatic f ailure or progress to chronic liver 
disease (HBV, HBV -HDV and HCV)  
Note  
For comprehensive management of viral hepatitis refer to the National Guidelines for Prevention and 
Management of Viral Hepatitis 2020.  
Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)  
HAV is the RNA virus from piconaviridae family under genus hepatovirus. It primarily infects the 
liver. The disease occurs sporadically or in epidemics and has an incubation period of 14 - 28 days. 
The group most affected is aged between 5 -14 years and adults are often infected  by spread from 
children.  203	Clinical presentation  
Mild flulike symptoms of anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, malaise, low -grade fever (usually < 
39.5°C), myalgia, and mild headache, dark urine appears first (bilirubinuria). Pale stool soon follows; 
Jaundice occurs in most adults. Abdominal pain itching (pruritus), Arthralgias and skin rash, (less 
frequent than the above symptoms).  
Investigations 
Specific diagnosis involves serological detection of Hepatitis A specific immunoglobulins IgM or   IgG 
antibodies in blood for acute and resolved infection respectively. Viral RNA detection   through PCR 
is definitive and confirmatory specialized laboratory test. Other tests include FBP, LFT, RFT and 
tests for other viral hepatitis viruses (HBV±HDV, HCV, and HEV).  
Treatment  
• Supportive management such as hydration, adequate feeding and avoidance of 
concomitant use of hepatotoxic medications including herbals is all that is required in mild 
infections. The disease resolves spontaneously in several weeks or mo nths.  
• Hospitalization is necessary in settings of acute liver failure. Therapy is aimed at
maintaining fluid replacement, balanced nutritional feeding, relief of pains and fever
including specific management for liver failure .
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) 
New-onset hepatitis B infection that may or may not be icteric or symptomatic. Diagnosis is based 
on detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and IgM antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen 
(anti-HBc). Recovery is accompanied by clearance of HBsAg wit h seroconversion to anti -HBs 
(antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen), usually within 3 months.  
Clinical presentation  
• Fever, anorexia, malaise, jaundice and abdominal pai n
• Enlarged   and tender liver
• Altered consciousness, coma (hepatic encephalopath y), and bleeding stigmata (i n
fulminant cases) .
Investigations 
• Serological evidence of specific viral antigen/ core antibody tests (HBc IgM or HBc IgG);
and biochemical alteration of liver transaminases (ALT, AST).
Treatment of Acute Viral Hepatitis B  
• No specific antiviral treatment is required.
• Offer supportive management and counselling.
• Offer a follow up plan at 4 or 6 weeks’ intervals for a clinical and laboratory re assessment
for evidence of symptoms recovery and biochemical remission.
• Re-test at 6 months to assess seroconversion status or progression to chronicity
Chronic Hepatitis B infection.  
Defined as persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for six months or more after acute 
infection with HBV.  
Clinical presentation 
• Usually  asymptomatic
• Right upper quadrant abdominal pains.
• Fatigue, malaise, anorexia, low grade fever; jaundice is frequent in severe disease.
• Ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and hypersplenism.
• Urticaria, arthritis, vasculitis, polyn europathy, glomerulonephritis, thyroiditis204	• HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBV DNA PCR
• LFT, RFT, FBP, HIV,
• Alfa Feto Protein (AFP)
• Colour Doppler ultrasonography or duplex Doppler ultrasonography or real time
ultrasonography.
• CT scan
• Fibros can (if available)
Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis B infection  
Pre Treatment Considerations – Who to Treat:  
• Patient in chronic active/ Reactivation phase characterized by elevated liver enzymes ALT
>2X ULN, HBeAg +ve, viral load >20,000.
• ALT > 2X ULN, HBeA g –ve, HBeAb –ve, viral load>2000(mutant strain).
• Patients with evidence of fibrosis development (APRI score >2)/cirrhosis should receivetreatment irrespective of age, and viral loads.
• Adults aged > 30 years with three determinations of persistently abnor mal   ALT levels
above ULN made at unspecific intervals during 6 -12month period   with DNA viral load >
20,000 IU/ml irrespective of HBeAg status.
• Pat
ients co -infected with HIV
Pre Treatment Considerations – Who not treat:  
• Treatment   should not be given  to patients with persistently normal ALT levels and APRI
score < 2 regardless of age and HBeAg status.
• Imm
unotolerant patients characterized by high viremia with normal liver chemistry, age
less than 30 years old   require no treatment. Re assess after 24 weeks interval.
• Patient in latent or inactive phase characterized by low viremia, normal liver chemistry withor without HBeAg sero -conversion requires no treatment. Re assess after 2 weeks’
intervals .
Pharmacological Treatment  
(Fo
r eligible adults with no contraindications to tenofovir) 
A: tenofovir (TDF) (PO) 300mg 24hourly; for at least 48weeks;  
Note  
• Re-asses at 24 weeks for evidence of biochemical and viral replication remission.
(Normalization of ALT, viral suppression to undetected level and seroc onversion to anti -
HBe).
• Offer a consolidated TDF therapy for extended 48 weeks for patients with evidence of
HBeAb sero -conversion and biochemical remission at the end of the first 48 weeks. For
patients still with detectable viral load and or not yet sero converted to HBeAb, continue
with Tenofovir 300mg daily dose and reassess every 6 to 12 months for HBV DNA,
HBeAg/Ab status
• Absolute Contraindications to Tenofovir in patients aged < 12 Years
OR 
S: entecavir in the following groups: Children and adolescents between age 2 to 18 years 
weighing between 10kg and 32kg

• Adults naive to nucleoside therapy (P O) 0.5mg 24hourly
• Adults with Lamivudine resistance/previous exposure; and decompensated cirrhosis -
1mg (PO)
• Adults with renal insufficiency (CrCl<49ml/min); dose should be adjusted according toInvestigations 
calculated GFR  205	A: Tenofovir (PO) 300mg 24hourly for   patie nts who have treatment failure with other 
Nucleotides analogues with low resistance barrier (i.e. Lamivudine) OR Interferon based 
therapy.  
Note  
• Lamivudine should not be prioritized due to their low resistance barrier. Interferon bas ed
therapy is not recom me nded in our setting due to undesirable side effects, route of
administration and high cost.
When to Stop Treatment 
• Patient who has been put on Nucleotides analogues therapy without evidence of cirrhosis
or APRI< 2 should be given a follow up plan.
• Patients who are HBeAb sero -converted after 48 weeks of consolidation therapy, with
persistently normal ALT and undetectable DNA levels should stop treatment and
monitored closely
• Pa
tients with evidence of HBsAb sero -conversion after completing consolidated th erapy
regardless of their DNA and HBeAg status should stop treatment.
• Tr
eatment in patient with Liver cirrhosis or significant Fibrosis is indefinitely
Monitoring and evaluation of therapeutic response and toxicity.  
• HBsAg, HBeAb, HBeAg, HBV DNA, AFP, ALT should be monitored pre, during, and post
treatment patients. PLUS (Fibrosis assessment by APRI scores) at 24/ 48weeks interval
• Renal functions in adults and growth development in children should be monitoredannually   for renal toxicity for patient on Tenofovir and Entecavir respectively.
• Abdominal Ultrasound (AUS) and Alpha Feto Protein (AFP) should be done at 24 - 48
weeks’ interval for   HCC surveillance.
Note  
Screening all close contacts is important. All at risk individuals eg. Healthcare workers, m en who 
have sex with men, patients on hemodialysis, prisoners, children born to mothers with HBV and 
patients requiring multiple transfusions, patients with non -B viral hepatitis should be tested for HBV 
and vaccinated if found negative for HBsAg and no ev idence of natural immunity  to HBV.  
HBV in Pregnancy 
All Infants and Neonates should have mandatory vaccination according to the recommended National EPI schedule. Neonates born to mothers infected with HBV and HBeAg positive, should receive at birth do se of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and HBV Vaccine, and then follow up 
with EPI program schedule at 6weeks. During pregnancy, prevention of HBV transmission from mother to childshould follow similar protocols as per adults with HBV infection.HBsAg pos itive 
pregnant mothers with VL >200,000 IU/ml should receive TDF at 3
rd trimester until 6months post -
natal period.

10.4.2.3 Hepatitis C virus (HCV)  
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small enveloped RNA virus and a member of the family Flaviviridae. 
HCV comprises six genotypes and hundreds of  subtypes with variable geographical distribution and 
bears significance in determining the rate of liver disease progression, development of HCC and specific therapeutic responses.

newborn wt <2 kg, determine mother's HBsAg status as soon as possible and, if she is
HBsAg -positive, also administer HBIG for infants weighing 2 kg or more (no later than age
1 week)
Note :  
• HBIG and HBV Vaccine should be given at different intramuscular sites  PEP should be
given in <24hours, may not be effective after 72hours of exposure.207	Investigations   
General baseline studies in pa tients with suspected HCV include the following:  
• FBP, LFT, RFT TSH, T3
• Screening tests for coinfection with HIV or  HBV
• Screening for alcohol abuse, drug abuse, or depression
• Pregnancy testing
Tests for detecting HCV infection include the following:  
• Hepati tis C antibody testing :
• Qualitative and quantitative assays for HCV RNA PCR
• HCV genotyping
• Serologic testing (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia is a common finding)
Treatment  
Use pangenotypic drugs which are efficacious, safe and cost -effective. 
Who to treat

hepatic related comorbidities.
Pharmacological Treatment  
All individuals diagnosed with HCV infection who ar e ≥ 12 years old are eligible for treatment 
children (<12 years old), the treatment should be deferred until they reach that age.  
S: ledipasvir (PO) 90mg 24hourly for 12 -24weeks  
AND  
S: sofosbuvir (PO) 400mg 24hourly for 12- 24weeks  
AND 
S: ribavirin (PO) gi ven in two divided doses *<75kg of Body weight =1g/day; >75Kg of 
Body weight =1.2g/day for 12weeks (in treatment naive patients) OR for 24 weeks (in 
treatment experienced patients) for genotypes 1, 4, 5 & 6.  
OR 
S: sofosbuvir (PO) 400mg daily AND ledipasvir  (PO) 90mg daily AND ribavirin if a patient 
has been previously exposed to other antivirals.       
Note  
• Due to complexity and variability of HCV management, care and treatment should be done
at the tertiary level facility
• Ribav irin is contraindicated in patients with anaemia (HB<8.5g/dL), and the dose should be
reduced if HB <10g/dL
Sofosbuvir is contraindicated if eGFR < 30ml/min/1.73m2  
When to stop medications  
• Ribavirin regimen should be stopped if patients’ HB drops to < 8.5g/dl during follow up
schedules.
• If there’s adverse drug reaction
• When there are ALT flares or massively increased ALT (>10 X UNL)
• If there’s evidence of drug to drug interactions - consider switching with medication with a
less interac ting potential208	Clinical monitoring and follow up  
• Assess treatment adherence, tolerance and toxicity at 4 weeks after treatment initiation.
• Treatment toxicity
• Stop Ribavirin if HB drops to <8.5
• Stop all DAAs if ALT >10 X ULN and other causes have been rul ed out
• Stop Sofosbuvir if eGFR drops to < 30ml/min/1.73m2
10.4.2.4 Hepatitis D Virus  
Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a defective RNA virus belonging to genus of delta virus that requires the 
helper function of Hepatitis B (HBV) for virion assembly, release and  transmission, and therefore the 
infection does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B virus. The routes of HDV transmission are 
similar for HBV the most important being sexually, percutaneous or   parenteral exposure to blood or 
blood products.  
Investig ations  
Serology assays for HDV immunoglobulin titres for IgM and IgG are diagnostic for acute and post 
exposure/chronic infections respectively. Real time PCR for HDV RNA is confirmatory.  
Treatment  
There is no specific treatment for acute or chronic HDV i nfection. 
Note  
The more risk population includes health care workers, transfusion recipients and haemophiliacs, 
PWID, and immigrants of endemic areas.  Nucleotide sequences of HDV obtained worldwide 
indicates the existence of eight genotypes, with genoty pe 1 being detected worldwide.  HDV 
Antiviral nucleotide analogues for HBV have no or limited effect on HDV replication and Pegylated 
interferon alpha is the only drug effective against HDV now and more than one year of therapy may be necessary as most of patients relapses after discontinuation of therapy
. 
10.4.2.5 Hepatitis E Virus  
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) belongs is a RNA virus belonging from a family Hepadna viridae  under 
Genus Hepevirus  and acute liver infection. The virus has at least 4 different type s: genotypes 1, 2, 3 
and 4. Genotypes 1 and 2 have been found only in humans. Genotype 3 and 4 viruses circulate in 
several animals (including pigs, wild boars, and deer) without causing any disease, and occasionally 
infect humans.  
Clinical presentation  
Prodromal -phase symptoms include the following:  
• Myalgia, Arthralgia, Fever with mild temperature elevations
• Anorexia, Nausea/vomiting, Weight loss. Dehydration, Right upper quadrant pain
Icteric -phase symptoms may last days to several weeks and include t he following:  
• Jaundice, Dark urine, Light -colored stool, Pruritu s
Other features include the following
• Malaise (most common), Arthritis, Pancreatitis
• Aplastic anemia, Thrombocytopenia
• Neurologic symptoms of polyradiculopathy, Guillain –Barré syndrome, Bell  palsy, peripheral
neuropathy, ataxia, and mental confusion
• Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and membranous glomerulonephritis
Investigations  
Serology assays for HEV immunoglobulin titres for IgM and IgG are diagnostic for acute and post 
exposure/ chronic infections respectively. Real time PCR for HEV RNA in serum and particularly in 
stool is confirmatory.  209	Treatment 
There is no specific treatment for cure or reversing the course of acute hepatitis E. The disease is 
usually self -limiting; hospitali zation is generally not required except for patients with fulminant 
hepatitis or for symptomatic pregnant women where severity of infection is usually high and associated with high rates of fetal loss and mortality especially in third trimester.  
Note  
• The v irus is shed in the stools of infected persons and enters the human body through the
intestine. It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. Usually the infection
is self -limiting and resolves within 2 –6 weeks. Rarely the infection can lea d to fulminant
hepatitis with acute liver failure.
• The virus causes sporadic cases and major epidemics of viral hepatitis and occurs i n
resource poor population with unhygienic conditions and through ingestion ofcontaminated water and food.
10.4.2 Por tal Hypertension  
This is  high blood pressure in the hepatic portal system which includes the portal veins and its 
branches which drains from most of the intestines to the liver. It is indicated when the hepatic 
venous pressure gradient exceeds 7mmHg, while  liver cirrhosis remains the most common cause 
which in our local setting is commonly caused by chronic viral hepatitis followed by heavy alcohol 
intake.  
Clinical presentation  
• Ascites, Splenomegaly
• Esophageal varices, and hematemesis
• Swollen veins of the  anterior abdomen (caput medusa) and hemorrhoids
Investigations  
• Radiological evidence of shrunken liver, with typical features of cirrhosis.
10.4.2.1 Ascites  
Ascites is the pathologic accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, and its most common  cause is 
cirrhosis.  
Pharmacological Treatment  
C: spironolactone (PO) 50mg – 400mg 24hourly incrementally till ascites resolves 
OR  
S: eplerenone (PO) 50mg 24hourly

Cholelithiasis involves the presence of gallstones which are concretions that form in the biliary tract, 
usually in the gallbladder. Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of one or more gallstones in 
the common bile duct (CBD). Treatment of gallstones depends on the stage of disease.  
Clinical presentation

OBSTETRICS, GYNECOLOGY AND CONTRACEPTION 
11.1 Bleeding in Pregnancy  
Bleeding during pregnancy is common, especially during the first trimester. Bleeding can sometimes 
be a sign of something serious, therefore it is important to know the pos sible causes and take 
adequate measures.  
11.1.1 Abortion  
It is a spontaneous loss of a fetus before it is viable (has the potential to survive outside the womb). 
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines it as expulsion or extraction of an embryo or fet us 
weighing 500mg or less, approximately at or less than 24 weeks of gestation. In Tanzania abortion 
is defined as loss of pregnancy before 28 weeks of gestations. Clinical features will depend on the 
types of abortion.

11.4 Obstructed Labour  
Also known as labour dystocia, is when despite adequate uterine contractions the baby does not exit 
the pelvis d uring due to being physically blocked. Obstructed may commonly be caused by; big 
baby, narrow maternal pelvis, malpresentation and malpositions.  
Clinical presentations  
• Prolonged labour ( ˃8hours of
active labour)
• Delayed second stage of labour
(˃1hour)
• Fetal distress

11.6 Prelabour Rupture of Membranes (PROM)  
It is the rupture of membranes (breakage of the amnio tic sac) before the onset of labor. If rupture 
occurs before 37weeks it is called preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM). Prolonged 
PROM is a case of premature rupture of membranes in which more than 24 hours have passed 
between the rupture and the onset of labour. Prolonged PROM for more than 18 hours is a risk of 
ascending infection which can lead to  chorioamnionitis  (infection of chorion, amnion and amniotic 
fluid.  
Clinical presentation

Heartburn (also called acid indigestion or acid reflux) is a burning sensation that often extends from 
the bottom of the breastbone to the lower throat. It is caused by some of the hormonal and physical 
changes  in pregnant women. 
Non-pharmacological Treatment   
Pregnant women should avoid: 
• Food and beverages that cause gastrointestinal distress
• Tobacco and alcohol
• Do not eat big meals, instead eat several small meals throughout the day
• Drinking large quantities of fluids during meal s
• Do not eat close to bedtime, they should give themselves 2 –3 hours to digest food befor e
they lie down
• Sleep propped up with several pillows or a wedge.
Pharmacological Treatment 
A: compound magnesium trisilicate (PO) as needed until when the heartburn  subsides.  
OR 
A: omeprazole (PO) 20 –40mg 24hourly 
OR  
C:pantoprazole (PO) 40mg 24hourly 
11.7. 11 Other Medical Disorder s in Pregnancy 
Other  medical  disorders  in pregnancy/other  gynecological  disorders  include  diabetes  mellitus, 
glucose  intolerance,  malaria,  HIV/AIDs  complications,  Pelvic  Inflammatory  Diseases  (PID)  etc. All 
these complications are discussed under specific diseas e chapters. 
11.7.12 Stimulation of Labour and Myometrial Relaxation 
Myometriu m stimulants should be used with great care bef ore deliver y especiall y in porous women. 
Use in obstructed labour should be avoided. 
Oxytocic’s are indicated for: – 
• Augmentation of labour
• Induction of labour
• Active management of third stage
of labour.• Uterine stimulation after delivery formanagement of PPH due to uteri ne
atony
Induction of Labour  
Indications/Contraindications  
• The indication for induction must be documented, and discussion should include reason forinduction, method of induction, and risks, including failure to achieve labour and pos sible
increased risk of Caesarean section
5
• If induction of labour is unsuccessful, the indication and method of induction should be re -
evaluated.
Pre-induction assessment  
• Health care providers should assess the cervix (using the Bishop score) to determin e the
likelihood of success and to select the appropriate method of induction.
• The Bishop score should be documented.
• Care providers need to consider that induction of women with an unfavorable cervix isassociated with a higher failure rate and increased rate of operative deliveries.
Post -dates induction  
• Women should be offered induction of labour between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks as this
intervention may reduce perinatal mortality and meconium aspiration syndrome withou t
increasing the Caesarean section rat e
• Women who chose to delay induction >41+0 weeks should undergo twice -weekly
assessment for fetal wellbeing235	Options for Cervical Ripening/Induction: Unfavorable Cervix  
• Intracervical Foley catheters are acceptable agents that are safe both in the setting of a
vaginal birth after Caesarean section and in the outpatient setting
• Do
uble lumen catheters may be considered a second- line alternative
Pharmacological Treatment 
A: misoprostol (PO) 25 µg 2 hourly for 24hours or Misoprostol (PV) 25 µg 6hourly for 
24hour s can be considered a safe and   effective agent for labour induction with intact 
membranes and on an inpatient basis.  
OR 
S: dinoprostone (PV) 3mg 6hourly a total of 2doses  
Note 
• Misoprostol should not be used in the setting of vaginal birth after Caesare an section due t o
the increased risk of uterine rupture.
• Ox
ytocin should be started no earlier than 4hours after the last dose of misoprostol.
Options for induction with a favourable cervix  
• Amniotomy should be reserved for women with a favorable cervix. Care should be given in
the case of unengaged presentation because there is a risk of cord prolapse.
• Af ter amniotomy, oxytocin should be commenced early in order to establish labour.
• In the setting of ruptured membranes at term, oxytocin should be consi dered befor e
expectant management.
• Wo
men positive for group B streptococcus (GBS) should be started on oxytocin as early
as possible after ruptured membranes in order to establish labour within 24 hours.
• Both high - and low -dose oxytocin may be considered within a hospital protocol.
• Because of the various concentrations, oxytocin infusion rates should always be recorded
in mU/min rather than mL/hr .
• Ox ytocin induction maybe considered in the hospital setting of vaginal birth after
Caesarean section.
• For induction of labour use: Oxytocin IV, the dose will depend on parity.
Primigravida  
A: oxytocin (IV) 5IU in 500mls of 0.9% sodium chloride the initial dose should be 
8-10drops/Minute, the titration may be gradually increased at intervals not shorter
than 20 minutes and increments of not more than 5drops/minute, until a
contraction pattern similar to that of normal labour is established. The
re
commended maximum rate is 40d/m.
Multiparous  
A: oxytocin (IV) start with low dose e.g., 2.5IU in 500mls of fluid titrate as above. 
Regulate the dose according to response.  
Note  
• Induction of labour with uterotonic drugs requires vigilant monitoring
• Induction of labour should only be attempted at hospitals with capacity to perform Caesarea
section
Augmentation of Labour 
If labour p rogress is n ot optimum la bour a ugmentation is n ecessary. Can b e achieved b y: 
A: oxytocin as above 
OR 
Artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) and oxytocin. If membranes are already ruptured and no 
labour progress the steps above should be followed; rule out obstruction before augmenting labour with oxytocin.  
Myometrial stimulation after delivery  
A: oxytocin (IM) 10IU after delivery of the infant; when no response give oxytocin (IV 
infusion) 20 units in 500mls of NS running at 10 –20 drops per  minute.  
OR 
C: ergometrine (IM) 0.25– 0.5mg after delivery of the infant, in the absence of myometrium 236	contraction and to prevent postpartum hemorrhage.  
OR 
A: misoprostol (PO/PV) 800 –1000µg 
Note  
Use Ergometrine cautiously in cardiac and hypertensive disea se patients  
Myometrium relaxation (Tocolysis)  
It is done to relax the uterus in order to:  
• Relieve fetal distress immediately
prior to Caesarian section
• Stop uterine contractions inpremature labour• Prevent uterine rupture
• Perform external cephalic versi on
Pharmacological Treatment 
B: nifedipine (PO) 20 mg stat, followed by 10 –20mg 6– 8hourly 
OR 
B: salbutamol ( PO) 4mg stat, when required (maximum daily dose 32mg) 
Note  
•β -stimulants should never be used if the patient had an antepartum hemorrhage
•β -stimulants are contra -indicated for cardiac disease and severe anemia in
pregnancy
11.7.13 Rhesus Incompatibility 
Incompatibility between an infant’s blood type and that of  its mother, resulting in destruction of the 
infant’s red blood cells (hemolytic anemia) during pregnancy and after birth by antibodies from its 
mother’s blood circulation.  
Investigations  
• Maternal Blood group+ Rhesus factor
• Paternal blood group+ Rhesus fa ctor
• Infant Cord blood at delivery for grouping, FBC, Coombs test to detect maternal antibodiesand Total Billirubin
Prevention of Rhesus isoimmunisation  
If the mother is Rhesus negative give  
C: anti D immunoglobin 300microgram within 72hours of delivery  
Antepartum 
C: anti D immunoglobulin (IM)at 28 -32weeks of gestation 
Abortion in Rhesus negative mother give 
C: anti D immunoglobulin 100microgram (IM) within 72hours of abortion

11.8.4 Dysmenorrhea  
It is a painful menstruation preventing normal activities and requires medication. There are 2 types 
of dysmenorrhea:  
Primary (n o organic cause).  Typically, pain occurs on the first day of menses, usually about the 
time the flow begins.  
Secondary (pathological cause)  e.g., usually the pain is due to other underlying causes eg PID, 
endometriosis, etc.

Doses of less than 3mg per week are usually enough to achieve this goal  Surgeries: • Tubal surgery for Tubal blockage • Myomectomy for uterine fibroids • Ovarian drilling is a possible surgical treatment for PCOS–related infertility  Referral Refer all patients with infertility to a gynecologist.      244		CHAPTER TWELVE SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — are generally acquired by sexual contact with a person who has an STI. The organisms (bacteria, viruses or parasites) that cause sexually transmitted diseases may pass from person to person in blood, semen, or vaginal and other bodily fluids. Reproductive tract infections (RTIs) occur in the genital tract and affect both women and men. Some RTIs, such as syphilis and gonorrhea, are sexually transmitted, but many are not. In women, overgrowth of endogenous microorganisms normally found in the vagina may cause RTIs (yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis).  Clinical Presentation• Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area. • Painful or burning urination. • Discharge from the penis. • Vaginal discharge that is abnormal in colour, odour, amount or consistency. • Itching or irritation of the vulva or vagina. • Unusual vaginal bleeding. • Pain during sex. • Lower abdominal pain • Genital ulcers, sores or blisters • Swelling, lumps or ulcer in the groin area  12.1 STIs/RTIs Management Approaches Management of STIs/RTIs can be done in either of the following approaches: • Aetiological laboratory approach: By identification of causative agents through laboratory methods and sensitivity pattern to the medicine to used, followed by disease-specific treatment.  • Aetiological clinical approach: By targeting disease treatment based on suspected causative agents diagnosed clinically. This is not appropriate at any health facility because of its demands on the clinical acumen of the service provider and the danger of incorrect diagnosis and, hence, insufficient treatment.  • Syndromic approach: This identifies clinical syndromes (symptoms and signs) followed by syndrome-specific treatment that targets causative agents which cause the syndrome.  Management of STIs/RTIs using Aetiological Laboratory Approach It identifies causative agents through laboratory methods, followed by disease-specific treatment. This is the best approach to be used at a Health Facility (HF) which has a Laboratory capable of doing the Laboratory Investigation and producing timely result(s) so as to enable the clinician to prescribe medicine (s) according to the causative agent(s) and sensitivity pattern.   Management of STIs/RTIs using Syndromic Approach This approach is recommended if the HF is not able to conduct appropriate Laboratory Investigation(s) and producing timely result(s) to enable the clinician to prescribe the medicine in accordance with causative agent(s).  Syndromic management of STIs is based on the diagnosis of defined symptoms and easily recognizable clinical signs. Each syndrome can be caused by several different causative agents. For each syndrome, a well-defined standard treatment which has been proven to be effective against most endemic causative agents for the syndrome are used.  Syndromic approach of managing STIs/RTIs entails the service provider to follow laid down steps in a flow chart which guides him/her in making rational management decisions for treating the client. These are therefore known as treatment flow-charts. They may also be known as treatment algorithms, treatment protocols or treatment decision trees. They guide the provider through a series of decisions and actions that need to be made. Each decision or action is enclosed in a box, with one or two routes leading out of it to another box, with another decision or action. Upon learning a patient’s symptoms and signs, the service provider turns to the flow chart for the relevant syndrome 245		and works through the decisions and suggestions it guides to manage the client accordingly. Each flow chart is made up of a series of three steps. These are: • The clinical problem (the patients presenting symptoms and signs), • The decision that needs to be taken, • The action that needs to be carried out. 12.2 Urethral Discharge Syndrome (UDS) UDS refers to the presence of abnormal secretions in the distal portion of the urethra.  Causes • Neisseria gonorrhoeae and  • Chlamydia trachomatis.    Clinical Presentation • Urethral discharge,  • Burning or painful micturition,  • Itchy urethra and increased frequency and urgency of micturition.  Note • Persistent or recurrent symptoms of urethritis may be due to drug resistance, poor compliance or re-infection. In some cases, there may be infection with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV). • Male patients complaining of urethral discharge and/or dysuria should be examined for evidence of discharge. If none is seen per inspection, the urethra should be gently milked from the ventral part of the penis towards the meatus. • Delayed or inadequate treatment may result into orchitis, epididymitis, urethral stricture and/or infertility.  Investigation(s) if the HF has a Laboratory capable of doing:  • Culture and Sensitivity • Gram stain • ELISA • Quantitative or qualitative PCR • Genetic sequencing  Management and Treatment of UDS (seeflow chart 12.1)  12.3 Vaginal Discharge Syndrome (VDS) VDS refers to change of colour, odour and/or amount of vaginal secretions.  Causes • T. vaginalis,  • C. albicans • Bacterial Vaginosis  • Neisseria gonorrhoeae • Chlamydia trachomatis  Clinical Presentation • Abnormal vaginal discharge,  • Burning or painful micturition,  • Itchy vulva,  • Increased frequency and urgency of micturition and/or painful coitus.  Note • A spontaneous complaint of abnormal vaginal discharge is most commonly due to a vaginal infection.  • T. vaginalis, C. albicans and Bacterial Vaginosis are the commonest causes of vaginal infection while  • Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis cause cervical infection.  • The clinical detection of cervical infection is difficult because a large proportion of women with gonococcal or chlamydia infections are asymptomatic. • vaginal discharge is therefore highly indicative of vaginal infection, but poorly predictive for cervical infection • Due to the high prevalence of gonorrhea and chlamydia, all women presenting with VDS should receive treatment for both vaginal and cervical infections. 246		• Delayed or inadequate treatment of VDS may result to endometritis, salpingitis, oophoritis or ectopic pregnancy.  • Gonococcal or chlamydial cervical infection may be asymptomatic  Investigation(s) if the HF has a Laboratory capable of doing:  • Wet preparation • Gram stain • Culture and Sensitivity • Fluorescent Microscopy • Pap test (Papanicolau test) • ELISA • Quantitative or qualitative PCR  • NB starts simple to complex  Management and Treatment of VDS (see flow chart 12.2) 12.4 Lower Abdominal Pain Syndrome or Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) PID is defined as the inflammation of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and pelvic peritoneum. It is also known as lower abdominal pain syndrome. It commonly occurs as a result of infection ascending from the cervix. It can also occur as a result of trans-cervical procedure. Causes • Neisseria gonorrhoeae,  • Chlamydia trachomatis and  • Anaerobic bacteria Clinical Presentation • Lower abdominal pain and tenderness,  • Painful micturition,  • Painful coitus,  • Abnormal vaginal discharge,  • Menometrorrhagia,  • Fever and sometime  • Nausea and vomiting. Note • Delayed or inadequately treated PID may lead to chronic lower abdominal pain,  • Pelvic abscess,  • Ectopic pregnancy,  • Dysmenorrhea and infertility.  Investigation(s) if the HF has a Laboratory capable of doing: • Wet preparation • Gram stain • Culture and Sensitivity • Fluorescent Microscopy • Pap test (Papanicolaou’s test) • ELISA • Quantitative or qualitative PCR   Management and Treatment of PID (see flow chart 12.3)  In-patient treatment of PID All patients with PID who have fever or body temperature ≥ 380C should be admitted for closer care. The recommended in-patient treatment options for PID are as follows: Regimen 1: A: cefixime (PO) 400mg 12hourly for 7-14days AND A: doxycycline (PO) 100mg 12hourly for 7-14days AND A: metronidazole (PO) 400mg 8-12hourly for 7-14days OR B: metronidazole (IV) 500mg 8-12hourly for 7-14days Regimen 2: A: ceftriaxone (IM) 1gm 24hourly for 5-7days AND A: doxycycline (PO) 100mg 12hourly for 7-14days AND A: metronidazole, (PO) 400mg 8-12hourly 7-14days OR A: metronidazole (IV) 500mg 8-12hourly 7-14days 247		Regimen 3: S: clindamycin (IV) 900mg 8hourly for 7-14days AND A: gentamicin (IV) 1.5 mg/kg 6-8hourly 7-14days  Note For all three regimens, therapy should be continued for two days after the patient has improved and then be followed by doxycycline (PO) 100 mg 12hourly for 14days. • Patients taking metronidazole should be cautioned to avoid alcohol. • Doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy.  12.5 Painful Scrotal Swelling (PSS) PSS is the inflammation of the epididymis and testis, often accompanied with scrotal pain, swelling and tenderness. It is also known as epididymorchitis. Causes • Neisseria gonorrhoea and  • Chlamydia trachomatis  Clinical Presentation • Scrotal pain,  • Scrotal swelling and tenderness,  • Scrotal oedema  • Fever  Note Among the common complications of painful scrotal swelling include infertility and scrotal abscess.  Investigation(s) if the HF has a Laboratory capable of doing:  • Gram stain  • Culture and Sensitivity • ELISA •  Quantitative or qualitative PCR  • Genetic sequencing  Management and Treatment of PSS (see flow chart 12.4) 12.6 Ano-rectal Syndrome (ARS) Is defined as soreness, burning, itching or other irritation of the rectum together with redness in the area of anus. Sometimes it is accompanied by diarrhea and it may occur as a toxic side effect of oral administration of certain broad-spectrum antibiotics. Causes • Neisseria gonorrhoeae,  • Chlamydia trachomatis,   • Treponema pallidum  • Herpes Simplex Virus.  • Shigella spp., or  • Entamoeba histolytica Clinical presentation • Purulent rectal discharge • Mucous rectal discharge • Watery rectal discharge • Soreness, burning, itching or other irritation of the rectum together with redness in the area of anus • There may also be ineffectual straining to defecate (“tenesmus”), sometimes mistakenly described as “constipation” by patients.  • The anus and rectum may be intensely painful, with external and internal ulceration • Abdominal pain or cramping, abdominal swelling, distention or bloating;  • Bloody stool (blood may be red, black, or tarry in texture),  • Burning feeling,  • Change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea;  • Fecal incontinence (inability to control stools),  • Flatulence; pain, which may be severe, in the abdomen, pelvis, or lower back,  248		• Urgent need to pass stool and watery diarrhea including multiple episodes. • A proctoscopic examination (which should be done, if feasible) will reveal rectal pus, bleeding or ulceration.   Note • Proctitis may be caused by Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., or Entamoeba histolytica as a part of gastroenteritis, which may manifest as diarrhoea with fever, anorexia, and abdominal cramps.  • Antibiotics that destroy normal intestinal bacteria and allow other bacteria to grow in their place may also cause proctitis. • Herpes proctitis may be mistaken for the rectal manifestation of ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease.  • Proctitis typically causes painless bleeding or the passage of mucus (sometimes mistaken for diarrhoea) from the rectum.  • All cases of proctitis in MSM should be treated for gonorrhoea and chlamydia infections.  • Symptoms of diarrhoea, bloody stools, abdominal cramping, nausea, and/or bloating may indicate Giardia spp infection or amoebic dysentery.  Other non-STI causes of ARS include: Anal fissure, Fecal impaction, Food intolerance, Gastroenteritis (bacterial and viral), Inflammatory bowel disease (includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis), Neurological damage, and Perirectal or perianal abscess.  Other symptoms might occur with rectal discharge includes gastrointestinal symptoms which vary depending on the underlying disease, disorder or condition. These may include: • Abdominal pain or cramping, abdominal swelling, distention or bloating; bloody stool (blood may be red, black, or tarry in texture), burning feeling, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea; fecal incontinence (inability to control stools), flatulence; pain, which may be severe, in the abdomen, pelvis, or lower back, urgent need to pass stool and watery diarrhea including multiple episodes.   Investigation(s) if the HF has a Laboratory capable of doing:  • Wet preparation • Gram stain • Pap test (Papanicolaou’s test) • Culture and Sensitivity • Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) • Treponema palladium particle agglutination (TPPA) • ELISA •  Quantitative or qualitative PCR  • Genetic sequencing • Fluorescent Microscopy  Management and Treatment of ARS(see flow chart 12.5.)  12.7 Oropharyngeal Syndrome Oral sex can lead to oropharyngeal STIs (infections of mouth and throat). Causes • Human Papilloma Virus,  • Herpes Simplex Virus,  • N. gonorrhoea  • Chlamydia spp • Treponema pallidum  Clinical presentation • Pharyngitis,  • History of unprotected oral sex   Investigation(s) if the HF has a Laboratory capable of doing:  • Wet preparation • Gram stain • Pap test (Papanicolaou’s test) • Culture and Sensitivity • Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) • Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) • ELISA •  Quantitative or qualitative PCR  • Genetic sequencing 249		• Fluorescent Microscopy  Management and Treatment of Oropharyngeal syndrome(see flow chart 12.6.)  12.8 Genital Ulcer Disease (GUD) GUD is a loss of continuity of skin or mucous membrane producing one or more lesions in the genital area.  Causes • Treponema pallidum,  • Haemophilus ducreyi,  • Chlamydia trachomatis,  • Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV) • Calymmatobacterium granulomatis.  Clinical presentation • Ulcer • Sore • Vesicle  Investigation(s) if the HF has a Laboratory capable of doing:  • Wet preparation • Gram stain  • Culture and Sensitivity •  Fluorescent Microscopy • Treponema palladium particle agglutination (TPPA) • Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) • ELISA • Quantitative or qualitative PCR  • Genetic sequencing  Management and Treatment of GUD (see flow chart 12.7)  12.9 Neonatal Conjunctivitis (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Ophthalmia Neonatorum (ON) means inflammation of the conjunctiva of a newborn baby of less than 1 month of age.  Is a potentially sight threatening condition. If the baby is older, the cause is unlikely to be an STI. Causes • Neisseria gonorrhoeae   • Chlamydia trachomatis. • Other non-STI causes of neonatal conjunctivitis include:  o Staphylococcus aureus,  o Streptococcus pneumoniae,  o Haemophilus and Pseudomonas spp,  o Viral, chemical and physical irritation. Presentation • Reddish conjunctiva,  • Oedema/swelling of the eyelids  • Purulent eye discharge  Prevention and control measures • Screening of pregnant women,  • Early treatment of VDS in pregnant women • Routine eye chemoprophylaxis in the newborn by providing  A: 1% oxytetracycline eye ointment to all newborns.   Note Examine the neonate and exclude other congenital diseases  Management and Treatment of Neonatal conjunctivitis (see flow chart 12.8) 12.10 Inguinal Bubo (IB) Inguinal and femoral bubos are localized enlargements of the lymph nodes in the groin area, which are painful and may be fluctuant.  They are frequently associated with lymphogranuloma venereum and chancroid  Causes • Chlamydia trachomatis  250		• Haemophilus ducreyi  Clinical presentation • Localized enlargements of the lymph nodes in the groin area,  • Painful and may be fluctuant.  • Pain,  • Fever  • Tenderness.  Note • In many cases of chancroid an associated genital ulcer is visible, but occasionally may not be.  • Non-sexually transmitted local and systemic infections (e.g. infections of the lower limb) can also cause swelling of inguinal lymph nodes. These should therefore be ruled out.   Investigation(s) if the HF has a Laboratory capable of doing:  • Culture and Sensitivity  • ELISA • Quantitative or qualitative PCR  • Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA)  Management and Treatment of Inguinal BUBO (see flow chart 12.9)  12.11STI/RTI flow charts Steps in using the flow charts: • Start by asking the patient for his/her symptoms.  • Find the appropriate flow chart, stated in the clinical problem box with “Patient Complaints of.” • The clinical problem box usually leads to an action box, which asks you to examine the patient and/or take the history. • Next, move to the decision box. After taking the history and examining the patient you should have the necessary information to choose Yes or No accurately. • Depending on your choice, there may be further decision boxes and action boxes.  Note For the appropriate management of STIs/RTIs syndrome, drugs in the watch group (azithromycin, cefixime and ceftriaxone) are the standard recommended for use as a first line treatment for the most STIs/RTIs starting at the Dispensary level, therefore, should be used only for STIs/RTIs at Primary HFs) 251		 Flow Chart 12.1: Management of Urethral Discharge Syndrome (UDS)

12.8   Management of Other Common STI Conditions  
Late Syphilis 
This refers t o Syphilis infecti on of mor e than 2years. 
A: benzathine benzylpenicillin (IM) 2.4MU once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks. 
AND 
A: azithromycin (PO) 2g stat.  
Syphilis in Pregnancy  
Pregnant women should be regarded as a separate group requiring close surveillance to detect 
possible re- infection after treatment has been given. It is also important to treat the sexual 
partner(s).  261		A: benzathine benzylpenicillin (IM) 2.4MU, as a single dose In case of late syphilis 3 doses of benzathine benzylpenicillin should be provided.  Congenital Syphilis All infants born to sero-positive mothers should be treated with a single intramuscular dose of benzathine benzylpenicillin,  50000IU/kg whether the mothers were treated during pregnancy (with or without penicillin).   Treatment regimens for early congenital syphilis (up to 2 years of age), and Infants with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid: A: benzyl penicillin (IV) 100000–150000IU/kg/day administered as 50000IU/kg/dose 12hourly, for the first 7days and every 8hourly thereafter for a total of 10days  For congenital syphilis in children 2 or more years A: benzyl penicillin (IV or IM) 200000 – 300000IU/kg/day administered as 50000IU/kg every 4–6hourly for 10–14days  The alternative regimen for penicillin allergic patients, after the first month of life A: erythromycin (PO) 7.5–12.5 mg/kg 6hourly for 30days.  Syphilis and HIV Infection All patients with syphilis should be encouraged to undergo testing for HIV because of the high frequency of dual infection and its implications for clinical assessment and management.  Genital Warts (Venereal Warts) Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted pathogen. Genital warts are painless but may lead to serious complications. The removal of the lesion does not mean cure of the infection. No treatment is completely satisfactory. Recommended regimens for venereal warts are as follows:  Chemical Treatment (High level Health Facility Management) D: Podophyllin 10–25% in compound tincture of benzoin, applied carefully to the warts, avoiding normal tissue. External genital and perianal warts should be washed thoroughly 4–6 hourly after the application of podophyllin. Podophyllin applied to warts on vaginal or anal epithelial surfaces should be allowed to dry before removing the speculum or anoscope. Treatment should be repeated at weekly intervals.  Other treatment approaches (Available at higher centres) Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, solid carbon dioxide, or a cryoprobe. Repeat applications every 1-2 weeks OR Electrosurgery OR Surgical removal  Treatment for Vaginal Warts Recommended regimens for treatment of vaginal warts are: D: cryotherapy (with liquid nitrogen) OR D: podophyllin 10–25% (allow to dry before removing speculum)  Treatment for Cervical Warts Treatment of cervical warts should not be started until the results from a cervical smear test are known  Management of Meatal and Urethral Wart D: Cryotherapy OR D: podophyllin 10–25% Note Urethroscopy is necessary to diagnose intra-urethral warts, but they should be suspected in men with recurrent meatal warts. 262		 CHAPTER THIRTEEN SKIN DISEASES AND ALLERGIC REACTIONS  13.1 Bacterial Skin Infections Bacterial skin infections can range fromimpetigo, folliculitis, furunculosis, erysipelas, cellulitis to recurrent boils. All these skin conditions are caused by either Staphylococcus aureus alone or together with streptococcus, but rarely streptococcus alone.  13.1.1 Impetigo Is a contagious primary infection of the skin involving the stratum corneum of epidermis. It is particularly common in children and people in disadvantaged areas.

A: Potassium permanganate 1:4000 (0.025%) solution 24 hourly for 2 -4 days  until dry. 
Where large areas are involved give a course of antibiotics for 5 -10 days (as for impetigo)  
o After the lesions have dried, apply an aqueous cream for a soothing effect.
Start with mild topical steroid cream for wet lesions and use ointment for dry skin lesions.  
If the skin starts scaling (condition becomes chronic), add/apply an emollient such as: emulsifying ointment or liquid paraffin.  
Note  
Potent topical corticosteroids may cause harmful cutaneous and systemic side effects especially if the 
use is prolonged or involves extensive body surface. Striae, acne, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, hirsutism and atrophy may result. There fore, avoid long term use; don’t use on 
weepy or infected skin. Advise patients NOT to use them as cosmetics (eg for skin lightening purposes)

13.8 Drug Reactions  
Drug reactions can be classified in many ways. One useful approach is to separate predictable 
reactions occurring in normal patients from unpredictable reactions occurring in susceptible patients.  
Predictable adverse reactions;  
• Over dosage (wrong dosage or defect in drug metabolism)
• Side effects (sleepiness from antihistamines)
• Indirect effects (antibiotics changing normal flo ra)
• Drug interactions (altered metabolism of drugs; most commonly involving the cytochromeP-450 enzymes)
Unpredictable adverse reactions  
• Allergic reaction (drug allergy or hypersensitivity; immunologic reaction to drug;
requires previous exposure or cros s-reaction)276	• Pseudo allergic reaction (non -immunologic activation of mast cells).
• Idiosyncratic reaction (unexplained reaction, not related to mechanism of action ,
without known or suspected immunologic mechanism).
Note  
• 80% of allergic and pseudo allergic drug reactions are caused by Beta -lactam antibiotics ,
aspirin, NSAIDs, and Sulfonamides

EYE DISEASES AND CONDITIONS 
14.1 Major Blinding Eye Diseases  
Eye Diseases are conditions affecting the eye. Diseases of most important are those leading to 
blindnes s or visual impairment. Blindness is defined as a presenting visual acuity of less than 3/60 
or central visual field of less than 10º in the better eye. The definition of blindness in children and 
infantsis the same as that in adults  though there are different methods for testing vision in young 
children until when they are at preschool age when normal visual acuity chart can be used.The 
common causes of blindness and visual impairment among adults are Cataract, Glaucoma, 
Cicatricial Trachoma, Vitamin A def iciency ( discussed under nutrition chapter ) and other corneal 
opacities, diseases of the Retina, uncorrected Refractive Errors and Low Vision.  These are diseases 
that affect both eyes however, they may be asymmetrical in their course. There are other eye 
diseases that do not lead into blindness or visual impairment, these are also addressed in this 
section. Patients presenting to eye clinic with uniocular eye complaint must have basic examination 
of the fellow eye as well.  
14.1.1 Cataract 
Cataract is cloud ing of the lens of the eye which prevents clear vision. It may be as a result of 
ageing process or secondary to trauma or inflammatory diseases. Children may be born with 
cataract or develop cataract in the early ages of life.  
Clinical Presentation  
• Vario us degrees of visi on
impairment unilateral or bilateral
• History of trauma with a sharp
object for traumatic cataract
• History of red eye for secondarycataract.
• Glare and haloes around light• Cloudiness in the lens seen as awhite mark behind the pupil and i ris
seen with slit lamp microscope
• Conjunctiva and cornea are clearand the whole iris can be s
een
clearly
• Obscured red reflex
Note  
• Cataract may present in all age groups, blindness due to cataract is reversible
• Treatment is only by surgery
• Early treat ment in children is mandatory
• White pupil in children may be a tumor in the eye, late referral may lead to permanent
loss of vision, squint, loss of eye or loss of life
Investigations  
• Visual acuity
• Slit Lamp Bimicroscopy
• Refraction depending on the
density of cataract
• Dilated Fundoscopy
• B Scan if no fundal view
• A Scan
• Biometry for Intraocular (IOL)
calculationFor congenital cataract, the following 
additional investigations may be 
ordered with Paediatrician 
consultation  
• ECG
• Echocardiogram
• Haemoglobin
• Full blood picture
• Chest X Ray
• Blood grouping and Cross -
matching
Surgical Treatment  
The only treatment available for Cataract is surgery. There are different cataract surgical procedures 
depending on the causes of cataract, age of the patient and surgeo ns’ skills and equipment 
availability.  285	Pharmacological Treatment

postoperative response
Referral: Refer all cases to eye surgeon for cataract surgery, available at some of the Districts, 
Regional, Zonal and National Hospitals. Children should be referred immediately to a Tertiary Health 
Facility with capacity to operate children’s eyes safely.  
14.1.2 Glaucoma 
Glaucoma is a syndrome characterized by optic nerve damage and peripheral visual field loss which 
may be associated with raised intraocular pressure. The main classes of glaucoma are open angle 
glaucoma and angle closure glaucoma.  
Note  
Glaucoma may be congenital, primary or secondary to other secondary to ocular conditions 
14.1.2.1 Primary Open Angle Glaucoma  
Clinical presentatio n 
• Painless loss of peripheral vision leading to absolute glaucoma as the end stage
• Affects mainly adults of 40 years of age and above
• Cornea and conjunctiva are clear
• Pupil in the affected eye does not react with direct light in advanced stage
• The optic n erve is always damaged, this can be seen through fundosc opy
• One eye may be affected more than the other
• First degree relatives of glaucoma patients are at increased risk
Note 
• Primary Open Angle Glaucoma does not have symptoms in early stages, hence rout ine
intraocular pressure checkup and fundus examinations should be done in all people of 40
years and above by some qualified eye care personnel  on annual basis.
• All suspected cases of glaucoma should be referred to qualified eye care personnel forconfirm ation of diagnosis and commencement of treatment plan
• Surgical treatment is usually preceded by medical treatment
• Refilling of antiglaucoma may be prescribed by a middle cadre eye worker but annualmonitoring should be done at a centre where there is an Op hthalmologist
• For advanced and complicated Glaucoma, patients should be referred to a health facilitywhere there are Glaucoma Specialists
Investigations:  
• Visual Acuity
• Slit Lamp bimicroscopy
• Fundoscopy
• Tonometry
• Gonioscopy• Refraction
• Visual Field Analy sis
• Fundus Photography
• Pachymetry test
• Optical Coherent Tomography
Pharmacological Treatment  
This is initiated after a diagnosis is reached by an ophthalmologist, refill of some medicines can be 
done by Assistant Medical Officers in ophthalmology but wit h regular reviews at a health facility with 
eye specialist. Medical treatment should be lifelong unless there are conditions necessitating other interventions  
C: timolol 0.25% or 0.5%, one drop in the affected eye, instill 12hourly. 
OR 287	D: betaxolol 0.25%  or 0.5%, one drop in the affected eye, instill 12hourly. Use lower 
strength in mild disease and those at risk of complications.  
In patients who comply to treatment and there is no good response  
ADD 
D: latanoprost 0.005% one drop, 2hourly in the affected eye. 
OR 
D: prostamide bimatoprost 0.03%, one drop, 24hourly in the affected eye. 
• These may be used as first -line in patients with contraindication of beta -blockers.
• They can be used as a second -line drug in patients on beta -blockers if the target IOP
reduction has not been reached.
In patients who are intolerant to prostaglandin analogue or are not responding give:  
D: brimonidine tartrate 0.15 –0.2%, one drop, 12hourly, in the affected eye. 
OR 
S: dorzolamide 20mg/mL, one drop, 8hourly in the affected  eye 
Failure to respond give: 
C: pilocarpine hydrochloride 2% or 4%, instill one drop in the affected eye 6 hourly. 
Note  
Pilocarpine causes long -standing pupil constriction so it should not be used unless a patient is 
prepared for glaucoma  
surgery or  as an alternative topical treatment for patients who are contraindicated for Timolol use. 
Consult a specialist  
before using it.  
In severe cases or while waiting for surgery, use : 
C: acetazolamide (PO) 250mg 6hourly 
Note  
•β-blockers are contraindicated  to people who are known to have overt asthma as this
group of medication may cause an acute asthmatic attack within a short time followi ng
instillation into the eye
• Brimonidine is contraindicated in children below 12years
Laser Treatment  
• It may be indic ated in addition to or instead of eye drops or surgery.
• Laser trabeculoplasty (Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty, Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty) or
cyclophotocoagulation are different options among others
Surgical Treatment  
It is done in all patients with poo r compliance and when medical treatment is not useful. There are 
different surgical techniques depending on the age of the patients, patients’ response to surgical 
treatment, surgeons’ surgical skills and availability of equipment. It is recommended that a ll 
surgeries are done by Ophthalmologists after thorough assessment of the patients.  
14.1.2.2 Angle Closure Glaucoma  
This is also known as Congestive glaucoma and commonly affect people aged 40 years and above . 
It affects more females than males.  
Clinical  Presentation  
• Acute sudden onset of painful red
eye in the affected eye
• Severe headache and cloudiness
of the cornea• Shallow anterior chamber
• Fixed and semi -dilated pupil288	• Severe elevated intraocular 
pressure.
• There is usually dramatic visualimpairment an d vomiting may 
be
present• It may be asymptomatic if IOPraises slowly
Note:  
• Primary acute Angle Closure Glaucoma is an Ophthalmological Emergency
• Refer all patients with Congestive glaucoma to eye specialist after initial medical treatment
to lower Intra ocular pressure
Investigations:  
• Visual Acuity
• Slit Lamp bimicroscopy
• Fundoscopy when cornea clear up
• Tonometry• Gonioscopy when cornea clear up
• Visual Field Analysis  for chronic
disease
Pharmacological Treatment  
Institute therapy and then refer the pat ient to eye specialist at the Regional, Zonal or National 
Hospital for investigations and proper management.  
Try to achieve immediate IOP reduction  
First -Line Treatment  
C: acetazolamide (PO), 500mg immediately as a single dose followed by 250mg 6hourly 
AND 
C: timolol 0.25 –0.5% eye drops, instill one drop 12hourly in the affected eye  
Use the above combined treatment until you have achieved your target IOP reduction, then continue 
with only Timolol eye drops for life unless patient has received surgical intervention and the IOP is 
reduced to normal level . 
Note  
Manage the associated pain and vomiting  
Second -Line Treatment  
If the above measures fail, use as a short -term treatment, givesystemic osmotic agents : 
C: mannitol 15 –20% (IV)1.5 –2mg/kg body weight  to run slowly over 30 –60minutes 
These medicines have diuretic effects, so they are only used as a single dose. They are also used in 
emergencies to prepare patients with high intraocular pressure for surgery as they lower intraocular 
pressure rapidly.  
Note  
Acetazolamide is a Sulphur containing medicine, do not use in patients allergic to Sulphur. 
Surgical Treatment  
This is done at a centre with Eye Specialists and necessary diagnostic and treatment equipment. 
Surgical or Later Peripheral Iridectomy w ill create a passage for the aqueous fluid from posterior 
chamber to the drainage angle.  
Referral: Management of advanced angle closure glaucoma is done by eye specialist. All patients 
with Angle Closure Glaucoma should be referred to eye specialist  for other management modalities . 
14.1.2.3 Childhood Glaucoma

*LASER treatment should also be considered in our settings in patients with severe and very severe
NPDR with the following situations as it has shown to reduce the rate of vis ion loss by half:  -
i. Older type 2 diabetics
ii. Difficult retinal view
iii. Prior to cataract surgery
iv. Only eye situation where the first eye was lost due to PDR
v. Regular attendance to clinic for follow up is likely to be poor
vi. Difficult to examine patient due to other  reasons.
** Monthly intra -vitreal anti -VEGF injections has been found to be effective on treatment for PDR  
*** Mild and moderate PDR should be treated with full scatter PRP (minimum 1200 shots in one 
sitting) or intravitreal anti -VEGF injection whichever is available, accessible and affordable. If both 
are available and affordable then anti -VEGF injection is the treatment of choice provided the patient:  
i. Is able to come for follow up at regular intervals - every month for 3 months and
then every 2 months for  3 months and then 3monthly
ii. Can afford the injections which may total up to 6 injections in the first year
iii. Has no contraindications to the injections?
If any one of the above does not apply, then the patient should have PRP done. 
Treatment options for DME  
Management of DME depends on the clinical stage of DME and treatment options available at the 
facility where the patient has been attended.  
Primary tests are required to be performed in order to grade the DME. Macula OCT for all diabetic 
patients should b e the baseline test to determine presence or absence of DME. Macular thickness of 
equal or more than 400 microns should be considered as DME. Those facilities without this tool, the 
clinical assessment will be the baseline test where the best corrected vis ual acuity will be the key 
point for grading which will be matched with the clinical findings. Therefore, VA of less than 6/12 
should be considered as DME case. It is important to exclude other causes of visual impairment 
before concluding the presence of DME. Use of anti -VEGF has been found to be effective in the 
treatment of DME .  
Table14.3: Treatment options for various grades of DME 
Grade Treatment option  Follow up period  
No DME Close observation  review after 6 to 
12months

14.2.5.4 Ophthalmia Neonatorum/Neonatal Conjunctivitis  
This is acute bacterial infection of the eyes that affect newbo rn baby during the first 28days of life. 
The infection is acquired from mother’s birth canal secretions. It is characterized by inflammation of 304	the conjunctivae, sticky eyes to abundant purulent discharge and eyelids oedema. Causative 
organisms are Neisser ia Gonorrhea, Chlamydia spp  and Staphylococcus spp .  
Clinical presentation  
• Patients present with massive edema and redness of eyelids and with purulent and
copious discharge from the eyes, clinical presentation ranges from mild (small amount of
sticky exu dates) to severe form (profuse pus and swollen eye lids) depending on t he
causative organism
• There is usually rapid ulceration and perforation of corneal which eventually leads t o
blindness if treatment is del ayed
• It usually presents 3 –4days of lif e
• Late and mild presentation is due to Staphylococcus or undefined
• Treat parents of a neonate with purulent discharge appropriately
Investigations  
• Pus swab for Gram Stain

haziness  and
• Neonates unresponsive to treatment within 2days.
14.3 Structural Abnormalities of the Eye 
These includes:  
• Squint : eyes are looking in different directions; one eye appears to be turned in or out, in
children or in adult. Refer urgently all children wh o present with squint to Paediatric E ye
Tertiary Centr e
• Ocular surface disease : The most common ocular surface diseases are pterygium and
Squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva.
• Eyelids abnormalities: eyelashes rubbing on cornea (trichiasis), inturne d eyelids
(entropion), eyelids bent out too much (ectropion), drooping eyelids (ptosis), inability to
close the eyes (lagophthalmos)
Referral: Refer all patients to health facilities with eye specialist for surgical intervention  
Note: Abnormal tissues ex cised from eye patients should be subjected to pathology examination for 
proper diagnosis 
14.4 Ocular Oncology 
14.4.1 Retinoblastoma  
It is the commonest childhood malignant tumor of the eyes. It is diagnosed between the first 1 –
3years of life. It has a lo wer survival rate after diagnosis hence, monthly screening of all under -five 
children is important for timely referral and management.  
Clinical presentation  
• White pupil reflex (leukocoria)
• Squint
• Rarely vitreous hemorrhage
• Hyphema• Ocular/periocular infla mmation
• Secondary glaucoma
• In late stages proptosis and
hypopyon
          Investigations  
• Visual acuity
• Tonometry
• Fundoscopy
• B Scan
• CT Scan of the head• Examination under 
anaesthesia
• Histology of an enucleated
eye in advanced disease
• Cerebral Spinal Fl uid analysis
in advanced disease
Non-pharmacological  Treatment  
Staging and treatment is done in specialized centres in consultation with Pediatrician and 
Oncologist . The following are treatment modalities:  
• Enucleation of the affected eye and the eye is taken for histology
• External beam radiotherapy
• Plaque radiotherapy
• Cryotherapy and laser photoablation306	Table 14.6: Classification of Retinoblastoma and recommended treatment options according 
the classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB)  
Group  Clinical feat ures Recommended Treatment options  
A All small tumors (3 mm or less) 
that are only in the retina and are 
not near important structures such 
as the optic disc or the foveolar 
i.e. Not less than 3 mm from the
foveolar and 1.5mmfrom the optic
disc.- Focal therapy (cryotherapy or Transpupillary
thermotherapy (TTT) .
- TTT is indicated for posterior located tumors.
TTT use Diode Laser (810nm) or 1064nm or
532nm. Tumor is heated until it turns slightl y
gray. Complete tumor regression can be
achieved by using 3 -4sessions
- Do not exceed 5 minutes per session to avoid
complication such as Cataract.
- Cryotherapy is done to a small tumor at
equatorial and peripheral retina. Under GA
place the probe precisely on the sclera, directl y
behind the intraocular focus of the  tumor. apply
triple freeze/thaw at 3week intervals un til
complete tumor regression.
Note:  Administer cryotherapy or TTT 3 -6 hours prior 
to chemotherapy if systemic treatment is indicated.   
Focal therapy synergistically increases drug 
penetration to the t umor  
B Tumor of > 3mm, close to the 
optic disc or foveola  
No subretinal fluid - 6cycles of standard dose chemotherapy ar e
indicated to allow adequate tumor reduction.
Note:  Standard dose is a combination of Carboplatin, 
Vincristine and Etoposide (VEC ). 
Do not perform focal therapy if tumors are located in 
the macular and juxtapupillary areas.  
- If focal therapy is indicated chemotherapy
should be given within 6hr of focal therapy toincrease drug penetration to the eye and tumor
C Well-defined tumors  
with small amounts of subretinal 
or  
vitreous seeding  (tumor cells 
floating within the vitreous cavity)  
NOTE: Vitreous seeding is one of 
the most challenging situations 
for eye -preservation therapy and 
is the primary reason 
for treatment  failure following  
conservative  management of 
retinoblastoma.  - 6cycle of standard dose Chemotherapy is
indicated .
- Chemotherapy should be given within 6 hoursof focal therapy (cryotherapy or TTT or
Subtenon Carboplatin) depending on site 
and
response to treatment.
- Chemotherapy cycles are given at 3 weeksintervals, every cycle is preceded by EUA and
focal therapy
.
Note:  Do not perform focal therapy if tumors are 
located in the macular and juxtapupillary areas  
- vitreous seeding can be managed by
plaque radiotherapy (need licen se), External
beam Radiotherapy, Enucleation or intravitreal
chemotherapy (Melphalan). Melphalan salvage
about 60% of eyeball with vitreous seeding (8 -
10µg is safe dose)
D Large or poorly defined tumors 
occupying up to 50% of the globe 
with widespread vi treous or 
subretinal seeding.  
There is retinal detachment up to 50% of the globe  - If unilateral Enucleate.
- If bilateral Start 3 cycles of chemotherapy
- If no response and no visual potential enucleate
the worse eye.
- If there is response complete 6cycles of
systemic chemotherapy.
- Local radiation for persistent vitreous seedsmay be indicated (plaque therapy or Intravitreal
Melphalan)
Note:  Focal therapy should be given prior to 
chemotherapy for every cycle.  
- Chemotherapy should be given within 6 hours
of focal therapy to increase drug penetration to
the eye and tumor
E The tumor is very large with one 
or more of the following features: 
- Enucleation with minimal manipulation is indicated for 
- All group E with no v isual potential,
- If all known effective treatment has failed307	• No visual potential
• Tumor in the anterior
segment
• Tumor in or on the ciliary
body
• Neovascular glaucoma
• When there is no dir ect
visualization of an acti ve
tumor (Vitreous
hemorrhage, cataract or hyphema) 
• Phthisical or pre -phthisical
eye
• Orbital cellulitis -like
presentation
• Total RD of more than 50%Note:  Optic nerve length should not be less than 
17mm to minimize the chances of leaving tumor at 
surgical site. Also, when performing enucleation: -  
•Take care not to perforate the globe
•Use prim ary orbital implant to achieve excellent
cosmetic appearance
•If histopathology results are positive for high risk
factors, 6cycles of Chemotherapy is indicated as
for Group D above .
Histopathological features in retinoblastoma are considered high -risk fac tors (HRF) for tumor 
progression and metastasis, thus their presence 
becomes an indication for adjuvant chemotherapy  
(HRF) includes:  
i)
Scleral extension
ii)Post-laminar optic nerve invasion
iii)Disease at the cut margin of optic nerve
iv)Massive chor oidal invasion of more than 3mm
v) Anterior chamber extension
• If no HRF no need of chemotherapy.
• Prosthesis and protective glasses are indicatedfor all children who have been enucleated
EOE  Orbital RB  • 3–6 cycles of high dose chemotherapy - followed
by en ucleation if tumor regressed significantly
• External Beam Radiotherapy and adjuvant
chemotherapy for a total of up to 12 cycles
NOTE: Exenteration is not encouraged at this stage 
since aim of treatment is for palliation.  
Distance 
metastasis  CNS involvement  RB- where 
Ct/MRI proved CNS extension or 
cerebral -spinal fluid is positive for 
RB cells  Palliative care according to the National Palliative 
Care Guideline 
Metastatic RB where bone 
marrow biopsy is positive  Palliative care according to the National Pa lliative 
Care Guideline 
Pharmacological Treatment  
Systemic chemotherapy is instituted by Oncologists and or paediatrician. Ophthalmologist institute 
intravitreal chemotherapy if need be.  
Referral : Refer to Oncology Section in this document for details  of Chemotherapy in Retinoblastoma 
treatment.  
Note  
 Close follow up is very important due to the following: -

•The risk is diminished with increase in age
•Also watch for secondary tumors like osteosarcoma
Referral: Refer all children presenting with a white pupillary reflex, squint or acute painful red eye to 
some qualified eye care personnel/ophthalmologist.  
14.4.2 Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Conjunctiva  
Invasive squamous cell carcinoma of conjunctiva is the major and most common ocular malignancy 
of the eye. The tumor typically occurs on the bulbar conjunctiva, originating at the limbus, and often 
spreads onto the cornea, globe, orbit and nasolacrimal system. The cancer is a slow growing tum or 
of middle- aged to elderly people.  
Clinical presentation  
• It manifests usually as a fleshy vascularized mass at the limbus. (temporal or nasally)

recommended, followed with topical adjunctive cryotherapy and or chemotherapy to the
residual conjunctival and scleral bed
o Double - four freeze -thaw cycles of cryotherapy to the remainin g
conjunctival margins, bed and limbus.
o For tumors that are adherent to the sclera, perform a superficial sclerectomyand use cryotherapy to the base.
• A large or multicentric squamous conjunctival mass should be managed by a surgeonexperienced in treatin g such lesions
• Removal of the eyeball and adnexa may be indicated for advanced stage
• Radiotherapy if required, for palliation after removal of the eye.
Referral:

recurrence.  
Referral: Refer to Ophthalmologist for confirmation of diagnosis and treatment. 
14.9 Orbital Cellulitis  
Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissues of the orbit posterior to the orbital septum. It may be 
a continuum of preseptal cellulitis, which is an infection of the soft tissue of the eyelids and 311	periocular region anterior to the orbital septum. Orbital cellulitis may result from an extension of an 
infection from the paranasal sinuses or other periorbital structures such as the face, globe, or 
lacrimal sac, direct inoculation of the orbit from trauma or surgery or as a haematogenous spread 
from bacteremia

Surgical Treatment  
Surgical drainage is only indicated when there is: 
• A decrease in vision
• Development of an afferent pupillary defect
• Progression of Proptosis despite appropriate antibiotic therapy
• The siz e of the abscess does not reduce on CT scan within 48 –72hours after appropriat e
antibiotics have been administer ed
• If brain abscesses develop and do not respond to antibiotic therapy, then craniotomy is
indicated
• Presence of a drainable fluid collection i s evident on CT scan in patients older than
16years
14.10 Visual Problems  
Visual problems may be due to refractive errors, damage to the eye or optic nerve. This may be an 
indication of underlying diseases such as diabetes or hypertension.  
Investigations  
• Assess ocular alignment
• Determine visual acuity accurately in both eyes by Snellen chart
• If vision is diminished, (less than 6/12), perform the following : -
Pin hole test
o Make a hole of about 1mm wide in a piece of dark/black paper – you can push a
hole in a paper or card with a pen tip
o Ask the patient to look through this hole at the Snellen chart
o If vision improves, this means that the patient has a refractive error
Red Reflex Test  
The patient looks past the examiners head focusing on a distant target.  
o With the ophthalmoscope at 0 (zero) the examiner keeps close to his eye and
then focuses the beam of light so that it falls on the pupillary area of the cornea
o The examiner stands about 60cm away from the patient.313	o In normal individuals, the examiner shoul d be able to see a red or pink colour
(reflex) through the pupil which comes from the retina.
Significance of absent red reflex  
If there is history of trauma or diabetes, the absence of a red reflex is probably due to:  
• Retinal detachment
• A vitreous hemor rhage
• Mature cataract
If there are cataracts, one usually sees:  
• Black shadows against the red reflex in immature cataract, or
• Absence of red reflex in mature cataracts
In a >50years of age with no history of trauma, diabetes or previous eye disease, an a bsent red 
reflex is often due to cataract formation, especially with decreased visual acuity.  
Fundoscopy 
Note  
Associated diabetes or hypertension should be adequately managed with referral, as surgery can 
only be considered with appropriately managed systemic disease  
Referral  
Urgent within 12– 24 hours  
• Sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes
• Pain or redness in one eye only especially with visual and pupillary abnormalities
• Recent proptosis of one or both eyes or enlargement of the eye (buphthalmos) in children
• Hazy cornea in children
• Unilateral watery eye
Within days  
• Squint of recent onset
• Suspected or previously diagnosed glaucoma
• Double vision following recent injury might indicate orbital fracture
• Leukocoria (white reflex from the pupil) especially in children
• Squint at an age if not previously investigated by ophthalmologist
• Visual loss in patients with systemic disease such as diabetes
Non-urgent referral  
• Cataracts in adults
• Refractive errors in teenage and adults
• Longstanding blindness– first visi t to health facility
14.11 Onchocerciasis (River Blindness)  
Onchocerciasis is a tissue parasitic infestation caused by a filarial worm, Onchocerca volvulus.  The 
microfilariae invade lymphatic system, subcutaneous and deep tissues producing acute 
inflammation and chronic inflammation at a later stage.  
Clinical presentation  
• Skin inflammation with papules
• Subcutaneous nodules
• Atypical skin lesions (scarred,
saggy, hanging areas of skin,
leopard skin)• Skin nodules under the bony
prominent areas
• Microfilaria in anterior chamber
• Scleritis and Keratitis leading to
Impaired vision as well as
blindness .
Investigations  
• Visual acuity
• Rapid diagnostic test (OV -16 - Onchocerciasis IgG)314	• Skin snip for microscopic examination
• Slit lamp  eye examination .
• B Scan
Pharmacological Treatment  
Treatment is done in consultation with dermatologists and infectious disease specialists.  
Apart from WHO recommen ded mass treatment campaign to community at risk with annual 
preventive chemotherapy which polarize/paralyze the worm, treatment depends on individual patient 
presentation.  
A: ivermectin (PO) 0.15mg/kg once every 12months for 12 –15years  
Note:  
• Patients wit h heavy ocular infestation require retreatment every 3 to 6 months.
• Treatment will only arrest progression of the clinical features but not reverse them.

15.7.10 Nose Bl eeding (Epistaxis) 
Nose bleeding is a condition which is common in adults. It may be due to a local cause in the nasal 
cavity (e.g.  trauma,  tumor,  foreign  body , septal  varices,  or septal  deviation);  or a systemic  cause 
(e.g. blood  disorders,  vascular  disor ders,  renal  failure,  hepatic  failure,  or use  of anticoagulants 
(warfarin,  heparin).  Most  cases  of epistaxis  are minor;  do not require  hospitalization.  Patients  with 
signific ant nose bleeding do require hospitalization. 
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Stabi lize the patient: put an open intravenous line, do blood grouping and cross matching
• Put the patient in a sitting position and advise the patient to pinch the soft part of the nose
gently for 5minutes
• Put on a gown, glasses, head light and sterile gloves a nd evacuate clots.Do a thor ough
head and neck examination
• Cauterize septal varisces (if any) using a silver nitrate pencil
• Do an anterior nasal packing by introducing into the nasal cavity as far posterior aspossible sterile Vaseline gauzes (or iodine so aked gauzes if not available) or special
merocele pack, using a dissecting forcep (if bayonet forcep is not available)
• Put rolled dry gauze on the collumela and plaster it
If the patient is still bleeding  
• Do a posterior nasal packing using a Foley’s cathet er introduced through the nasal cavit
y
into the oropharynx, balloon it with normal saline up to 10 –15cc while pulling it outward t o
impinge on the posterior nasal choana, then do anterior nasal packing as above
• Put dry gauze on the nose to prevent necrosis  of the collumela and fix the catheter on t he
nose with an umbilical clamp
• Almost all of the nasal bleedings will be controlled by this way
Note:  Remove the packs after 72 hours

Oral diseases and conditions are common and range from dental caries, periodontal conditions, 
dental abscess, acute bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections, traumat ic injuries, 
tumors, and lesions affecting the maxillofacial region (perioral, jaws and face). Before doing oral 
examination or any dental procedures, patients should gurgle with hydrogen peroxide 3% or 
povidone iodine 2% to minimize infectious agent’s con tamination between patient and oral health 
care provider.

16.2 Dental Caries 
Dental caries is caused by bacteria of the dental plaque which feed on sugar y food substrates 
producing acid as by -products which dissolve the minerals of the tooth surface. 
Clinical presentation  
Early stage– asymptomatic  
• Intermediate stage: black/brown spot which may be visible on any surface of tooth
• Cavities developing on toot h surface
• Pain/toothache elicited by hot, cold, or sweet foods/drinks350	Late stage  
• Pain may be spontaneous, intermittent, sharp, and severe, even interfering with sleep.
• Tenderness on percussion of the tooth
Investigation
Periapical x -ray of tooth/teeth  may need to be done specially to confirm extent of caries for 
treatment decision e.g. the caries contained in the dentine can be distinguished from pulpal caries.  
Prevention 
• Proper counseling to avoid frequent use of sugary foods and drinks
• Use fluoridat ed toothpaste to brush teeth at least twice a day
• Provide preventive measures to early lesions presenting as a spot on the enamel without
cavitation and softening
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Lesion with cavitation but confined to dentine– filling/restora tion of teeth with suitable filling materials 
(e.g. amalgam, composite, glass ionomer)  
Perform endodontic treatment with combination of antibiotics wherever possible for tooth with lesion 
involving the pulp (with or without periapical abscess otherwise too th extraction is done  
Pharmacological Treatment  
Analgesics: for toothache  
A: paracetamol (PO) 1gm 8hourly for 3days  
OR 
A: ibuprofen (PO) 400mg 8hourly for at least 3days  
OR 
 C: diclofenac (PO) 50  mg 8hourly for at least 3days  
Antibiotics for endodontic treatment

AND 
A: metronidazole (PO) 400mg 8hourly for 5days  
16.3 Odontogenic and Non -Odontogenic Orofacial Infections  
16.3.1. Periapical abscess 
This clinical condition arises as a complication of inflammation of the dental pulp or periodontal 
pocket. The condition may be acute and diffuse, chronic with fistula or localized and circumscribed. 
It is in the apical aspect of the supporting bone.  
Clinical presentation  
• The patient complains of tooth ache
• Pain during intake of hot or cold foods/drinks
• Pain on bringing the tooth on occlusion
• Tenderness on percussion (vertical percussion)
• Swelling of gingiva around the affected tooth
Non-pharmac ological Treatment  
• For posterior teeth: Extraction of the offending tooth under local anesthesia (can perform
root canal treatment for posterior teeth instead of tooth extraction under good clinical
judgement)
• Perform Incisional and drainage under local an esthesia followed by analgesics.
For anterior teeth (incisors, canine and premolars): extraction is carried out only when root canal 
treatment is not possible  351	Pharmacological Treatment  
A: paracetamol (PO) 1gm 6hourly for 3days. 
AND 
A: amoxicillin (PO ) 500mg 8hourly for at least 7days  
OR 
A: erythromycin (PO) 500mg 8hourly for 7days (if allergic to penicillin) 
AND 
A: metronidazole (PO) 400mg 8hourly for 7days  
16.3.2 Dental Abscess (Odontogenic Abscess)  
Dental abscess is an acute lesion characterize d by localization of pus (caused by polymicrobial 
infection) in the structures that surround the teeth. 
Clinical presentation  
• Fever and chills
• Throbbing pain of the offending tooth
• Swelling of the gingiva and sounding tissues
• Pus discharge around the ging iva of affected tooth/teeth
• Trismus (inability to open the mouth)
• Regional lymph nodes enlargement and tender
• Aspiration of pus
Investigation  
Pus for Gram stain, culture, and sensitivity if the patient doesn’t respond to initial antibiotic 
treatment.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Incision and drainage and irrigation (irrigation and dressing is repeated daily). Irrigation is
done with 3%hydrogen peroxide followed by 0.9% sodium chloride.
• Supportive therapy carried out depending on the level of debilitati on. Most patients need
rehydration and detoxification using 0.9% sodium chloride (IV) or compound sodium
lactate (IV).
Pharmacological Treatment 
A: amoxicillin (PO) 500mg 8hourly for 5days 
AND 
A: metronidazole (PO) 400mg 8hourly for 5days.  
In severe case s, 
B: amoxicillin+ clavulanic acid (FDC) (PO) 625mg 8hourly for 5days  
AND 
A: metronidazole (PO) 400mg 8hourly for 5days.  
If a patient is allergic to  penicillin 
A: erythromycin (PO) 500mg 8hourly for 5days 
Where parenteral administration of antibiotics is necessary (especially when the patient cannot 
swallow and has life threatening infection ), consider the following  
B: ceftriaxone (IV) 1gm once daily for 5days  
AND 
B: metronidazole (IV) 500 mg 8hourly for 5days  
AND 
A: gentamicin (IV) 80mg 8hourly for 5days 
Note  
Incision and drainage is mandatory in cases of deeper spaces involvement followed by a course of 
antibiotics. The practice of prescribing antibiotics to patients with abscess and denying referral for definitive care until pus has established or resolved has been found to lead to more problems for orofacial infections therefore early referral for definitive care is important.  352	16.3.3 Ludwig’s Angina  
This is a serious life threatening generalized septic cellulitis of the fascia spaces found on the floo r of 
the mouth and tongue. It is an extension of infection from mandibular molar teeth into the floor of the 
mouth covering the submandibular, sublingual, and submental spaces bilaterally.  
Clinical presentation  
• Brawny induration
• Tissues are swollen, board  like, no t
pitted and no fluctuance
• Respiratory distress
• Dysphagia• Tissues may become gangrenous
with a peculiar lifeless appearance
on cutting
• Three fascia spaces are involv ed
bilaterally (submandibular,
submental, and sublingual)
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Incision and drainage is done (even in absence of pus) to relieve the pressure and allow
irrigation
• Only when the airway distress is significant and there is evidence that it is not relieved byincision and drainage then tracheostomy is needed. Sup portive care includes high protei
n
diet and fluids for rehydration and detoxification. During incision and drainage pus shoul d
be taken for culture and sensitivity. Offending tooth should be removed at the same sitti ng
if the patient can open the mouth.
Pharmacological Treatment 
B: ceftriaxone (IV) 1g 24hourly for 5days  
OR 
B: amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (FDC) (PO) 625mg8hourly for 5days  
AND 
B: metronidazole (IV) 500mg 8hourly for 5days

A: erythromycin (PO) 500mg 6hourly f or 5days  
Once the patient can swallow, replace IV medication with oral treatment.  
Note  
For this condition and other life -threatening oral conditions consultation of available specialists 
(especially oral and maxillofacial surgeons) should go parallel with  life saving measures.  
16.3.4 Pericoronitis

16.3.5 Osteomyelitis of the J aw 
Osteomyelitis is an infection involving all layers of bone in which widespread necrosis may occur. It 
is rare in the maxilla d ue to the rich blood supply, but on occasions may affect the anterior palate 
where the bone is thicker. It is more common in the mandible, usually because of dental infection, 
trauma, or a blood -borne infection.  
Clinical presentation  
• In the initial stage there is no
swelling
• Malaise and fever
• Enlargement of regional lymph
nodes
• Teeth in the affected ar ea
become painful and loose.• Later as the bone undergoes
necrosis the area becomes
very painful and swollen
• Pus ruptures through the
periosteum and discharg ed
outside the skin surfac e
through a sinus
Investigation  
X-ray – OPG (Orthopantomography ) or mandibular lateral oblique, water’s view for maxilla/midface.
The x -ray will show sequestra formation in chronic stage. In early stage features seen in x- ray
include widening of periodontal spaces, changes in bone trabeculation and areas of radiolucency .
Perform culture and sensitivity of the pus aspirate to detect the specific bacteria.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Incision and adequate drainage to confirmed p us accumulation which is accessible.

A: fluconazole (PO) 150mg 24hourly for 7days  
OR  
D: itraconazole (PO) 200mg 24hourly for 7days 
Note  
 Candidiasis has several risk factors; it is recommended that for HIV/AIDS patients with candidiasis, 
refer to the Tanzania HIV/AIDS Guidelines.  
16.5 Viral Infections 
16.5.1 Herpes Simplex Virus 
This is a viral infection commonly affecting the lips and perioral soft tissues presenting as 
papulovesicular lesions which ultimately ulcerate. The  primary infection affects mainly the gingiva 
and palate.  
Clinical presentation  
• A prodromal of tingling, warmth or itching at the site usually precedes the recurrence
• About 12 hours later, redness appears followed by papules and then vesicles
• These vesicle s then burst, weep, dry, scab and then heal
• The length of the cycle is variable 5 –12days mean time being 7days
Non-pharmacological Treatment

ulcerations. Usually affect the non -keratinized oral mucous membrane.  
Clinical presentation  
Minor Aphthous Ulcers  
• Small round or ovoid ulcers 2– 4 mm in diameter, surrounded by an erythematous halo and
some edema.

16.7 Post Extraction Complications  
16.7.1 Bleeding socket  
Commonly due to disturbing the blood clot by the patient through rinsing or inadequate compression 
on the gauze, though at times may be due to bony/tooth r emnants.  
Clinical presentation  
Bleeding socket can be primary (occurring within first 24 hours post extraction) or secondary 
occurring beyond 24 hours post extraction.  
Primary Bleeding Socket  
• Active bleeding from the socket
• Patient may be dehydrated and pale if has lost significant amount of blood
• Features of decreased pulse rate and volume, hypotension also if patient has lost
significant amount of blood356	Secondary bleeding  
• The socket may show features of infection or trauma
Non-pharmacological T reatment  
Give local anesthesia (lignocaine 2% with adrenaline 1 in 80,000 IU). 
Clear any clot available and examine the socket to identify source of bleeding. 
Suturing of the wound only when necessary (like significantly traumatized gingiva). 
Give proper instructi ons t o follow (bit e on gauz e pack for 30 minutes, not t o rins e or eat hot foods on 
that day at least for 12 hours and avoid dis turbance to the wound). 
Pharmacological Treatment 
Analgesics may be needed: 
A: paracetamol (PO) 1g 8hourly for 3days  
OR 
C: diclofenac (PO) 50mg 8hourly for 3days  
OR 
A: ibuprofen (PO) 400mg 8hourly for 3days  
AND 
C: tranexamic acid (PO) or (IV) 500 mg 8hourly for the first 24hours.  
16.7.2 Infected Socket  
A post extraction complication due to infection of the clot due to contaminati on (infected socket). The 
condition is painful and if not managed well could lead to osteomyelitis.  
Clinical presentation  
• Severe painful socket 2 –4days after tooth extraction
• Fever
• Necrotic blood clot in the socket
• Swollen gingiva around the socket
• Someti mes there may be lymphadenopathy and trismus (inability to open the mouth)
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Socket debridement under local anesthesia with lignocaine 2% and irrigate with hydrogen peroxide 
3% followed with copious amounts of normal saline. Th e procedure of irrigation is repeated the 2nd 
and 3rd day and where necessary can be extended to the 4th day if pain persists.  
Pharmacological Treatment  
Patient is instructed to rinse with 3% hydrogen peroxide or 2% povidone iodine 3– 4 times a day.  
antibiotics should be prescribed to prevent progression to osteomyelitis:  
A: amoxicillin (PO) 500mg 8hourly for 5 –7days  
OR 
B: azithromycin (PO) 500mg 24hourly for 3days  
AND 
A: metronidazole (PO) 400mg 8hourly for 5days  
Investigation  
Periapical X -ray of th e socket may be necessary when there is limited improvement despite 
treatment.  
16.7.3 Dry Socket  
This is a post extraction complication due to failure to form a clot (dry socket). The condition is very 
painful, and it differs from an infected socket by la ck of clotting and levels of severity of pain.  
Clinical presentation  
• Severe pain 2 –4 days’ post -
extraction
• Pain exacerbated by entry of air on
the site• Socket devoid of clot
• Surrounded by inflamed gingiva357	Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Treatment is unde r local anesthesia with lignocaine 2%, socket debridement and irrigation with 
hydrogen peroxide 3% followed with copious amount of normal saline. The procedure of irrigation is 
repeated on the 2nd and 3rd day and where necessary can be extended to the 4th day if pain 
persists.  
16.7.4 Oro -Antral C ommunication  
Occasionally, the uncomplicated extraction of a tooth may fracture the thin floor of the sinus and cause an oro- antral communication (OAC). More commonly, the communication is produced by 
attempts to remove retained tooth root so that the antrum floor is perforated, or the apex displaced 
into it.  
Clinical presentation  
• Air passing from the nose into the mouth and the surgeon will be able to see bubbling
through the communication when the patient is ask ed to breathe out.
• Blood from the wound, drinks and mouthwashes used to rinse the mouth may pass
through the sinus into the nose.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Immediately on diagnosing a communication the tooth should be checked to ensure that it has bee n 
completely extracted. All pieces of loose bone that might form sequestra are then gently removed. 
The buccal plate of alveolar bone is trimmed if a flap has been raised but is otherwise left alone. Buccal advancement flap is the operation of choice to repair the fistula (oro -antral communication)  
Pharmacological Treatment  
A: metronidazole (PO) 400mg 8hourly for 5days 
AND 
B: amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (FDC) (PO) 625mg 12hourly for 7days  
16.8 Tooth Sensitivities 
Teeth bec ome sensitive because of worn enamel, or exposed tooth roots, cavity, gingival collapse, a 
consequence of periodontitis, tartar (calculus) build -up, cracked or chipped tooth and recent filling.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Recommend brushing teeth with d esensitizing toothpaste for sensitive teeth
• Desensitizing or bonding –  apply bonding resin material or Glass Ionomer Cement to seal
the area around the tooth
• Root canal treatment – for severe, prolonged discomfort
• Prevent tooth- grinding (bruxism) by fabri cating to the patient a mouth guard
Pharmacological Treatment  
C: sodium fluoride 1.1 % +potassium nitrate 5% (fluoride gel or varnish), apply 12hourly  
16.9 Tooth Eruption, Shedding and Edentulousness  
16.9.1 Eruption of Teeth 
Eruption of deciduous /primar y teeth usually starts at five months of age. Symptoms associated with 
it like fever and diarrhea are normal and self -limiting unless any other causes can be established. 
The following conditions are usually associated with tooth eruption and should be ref erred to dental 
personnel: eruption cysts, gingival cysts of the newborn and pre/natal teeth.  
Note  
“Nylon teeth” is a myth/belief existing in some traditions. These are conditions associate d with the 
eruption of deciduous/primary teeth358	16.9.2 Shedding of  Deciduous Teeth 
Phenomenon of losing deciduous/primary teeth occurring between ages of 5 –12 years is a normal 
physiological change. Deciduous teeth should be left to fall out themselves unless the teeth are 
carious or there is any other indication. Parent s should be counseled accordingly and be instructed 
to assist their children to loosen the already mobile teeth and when there is no success, or the 
permanent teeth are erupting in wrong direction should consult a dentist.  
16.9.3 Edentulousness  
It is the partial or full loss of natural teeth and subsequent resorption of the alveolar bone.  
Diagnosis  
Diagnostic cast, Periapical X -ray, OPG. 
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Design and fabricate dental prosthesis
• Dental prosthesis may be fixed, partial dentures and complete/full dentures
• Materials required in fabrication of these prostheses are: alginate impression materials,silicone impression materials, implant system, gypsum dental stone, Acrylic resin
s
(monomer and polymer), porcelain, ceramic, metal alloys,  wax etc.
16.9.3.1 Dental implant (s)  
A permanent device that is biocompatible and bio -functional placed on or within the bone to provide 
retention for fixed or removable prostheses.  
Indications of Dental Implant(s)  
• Single tooth replacement.
• Multiple teet h replacement.
• Retention of removable prosthesis in partially edentulous patient.
• Retention of over denture in completely edentulous patient (In mandible two 2 implants are
required for support and in maxilla 4 implants are needed to support the denture.
• Retention of fixed prostheses completely edentulous patient (In mandible 4 implants
needed and in maxilla - 6-8implants required).
• Retention of maxillofacial prosthesis.
Investigation  
Radiographic examination
Maxillary and mandibular bone status may be evaluated in combination of periapical X -ray, occlusal 
radiograph, panoramic radiograph, lateral cephalography, MRI and CT -Scan.  
Surgiguids
They are custom made for each patient. They are used as guides for drilling in the optimum 
locations implant placement  then removed after placement.  
Study cast
Evaluate occlusal centric relation, including any premature occlusal contacts, the relationship of the 
edentulous area to the adjacent natural teeth and opposing arches.  
Intra -operatively, the following should be  observed to have a successful Implant  
• Assess anatomical variation and abnormalities of vital structures so that implant should
never touch them.
• Maintain Sterility as interfere with Osseo -integration
Surgical technique 
Adequate blood supply (proper incis ion design and flap reflection. Using sharp gradual series of drill 
sizes with copious amount of irrigation by normal saline.  359	Pharmacological Treatment after implant insertion  
Mouth wash: Do not swallow  
A: hydrogen peroxide 3% 6hourly for at least for 5da ys 
OR 
B: chlorhexidine gluconate 0.2% 12hourly at least for 5days

AND 
A: amoxicillin (PO) 500mg 8hourly for 8days 
16.10 Malocclusions  
Malocclusion is any variation in the arrangement of teeth leading to ab normal occlusion to the extent 
that may be functionally harmful or aesthetically objectionable.  
Clinical presentation  
• Class I malocclusion: Diagnosed when there is any occlusal abnormality or individual tooth
malocclusion in a case with normal arch relationship in anteroposterior plane.
• Class II malocclusion: Mesiobuccal cusp of upper first permanent molar occludes mesial tothe buccal developmental groove of the lower first permanent molar
• Class III malocclusion: The upper first permanent molar occludes di stal to the buccal
developmental groove of the lower first permanent molar
• Skeletal malocclusions: These malocclusions are caused by defects in the underlying
skeletal structure itself.
Non-pharmacological Treatment:  
• Preventive orthodontics
It includes p arent counselling, caries control, space maintenance, managing exfoliation of deciduous 
teeth, release of abnormal frenal attachments, treatment of blocked permanent first molars, 
management of abnormal oral musculature and related habits.  
• Interception orthodontics
o Correction of anterior or posterior cross bite, relieving crowding of the permanent
dentition, Space closure, treatment of anterior open bite, Deep bite, reverse overjet,
proclination of the upper labial segment and oral habits management by pat ient
education and monitoring or removable and fixed habit breaker
o For skeletal malocclusion: Use of extra oral appliances like reverse pull headgear
combined with an RME, high pull head gear and chin cups or functional appliance s
are indicated for skeleta l malocclusion in growing patients
• Definitive Orthodontic
Alignment of teeth in patient with dental alveolar malocclusion by using removable, clear aligner or fixed appliances. Simple removable appliances are very useful in our local settings especially f or 
mild to moderate malocclusion in teenagers and include retainers or space maintainers.  
16.11 Management of Maxillofacial Trauma 
16.11.1 Traumatic Dental Injuries  
It may result in loosening, displacement and or loss of teeth, fracture of teeth and or bo ne, 
lacerations, and bleeding. The commonest causes are falls (in sports and play) at home or school 
and motor accidents. Most affected are upper incisors.  360	Clinical presentation  
Type Presentation 
Tooth 
concussion  Is an injury to supporting tissues of tooth, without displacement  
Sublaxation  Is the partial displacement, but is commonly used to describe loosening of a tooth 
without displacement  
Intrusion  Is the displacement of tooth into its socket often accompanied by fracture of alveolar 
bone 
Luxation  Is the displacement of tooth laterally, labially or palatally 
Avulsion  Is the complete loss of tooth from the socket  
Soft tissue Injuries  
Abrasion
Where friction between an object and the surface of the soft tissue cause s a wound. This wound is 
usuall y superficial, denudes the epithelium, and occasionally involves deeper layer s. 
Contusion/Bruising  
Indicates that some amount of tissue disruption has occurred within the tissues, which resulted in subcutaneous or sub mucosal hemorrhage without a break in  the soft tissue surface.  
Laceration
Is a tear in the epithelial and sub epithelial tissues?  It is perhaps the most frequent type of soft tissue 
injury, is caused most by a sharp object  
16.11.2 Facial Bones Injuries  
The commonest causes of fractured jaws  are fights, road accidents, falls and sport. They occur 
chiefly in males between 15 -35years of age and twice as frequently in the mandible as in the 
maxilla.  
Initial assessment  
The initial assessment should not concentrate on the most obvious injury but i nvolve a rapid survey 
of the vital functions to allow management priorities to be established.  
The Mandible  
The commonest sites of fracture in the mandible are the condyle neck, the angle, and the canine 
region.  
Middle third of the face  
Fractures of the middle third of the face involve a complex of bones, which include the paired bones, 
the maxilla, palatine, zygomatic, nasal, lachrymal and inferior conchae, together with the single 
vomer and ethmoid bones.

Maxilla  Skull x -ray (Occipitomental, submental vertex, lateral face view), CT scan.  
Naso - ethmoidal complex  CT scan  
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Intra-oral examination: Look for soft -tissue lacerations, dentoalveolar fractures and
damage to teeth.
• Check for tooth fragments which may be displaced in soft tissues.
• Examine traumatized teeth for mobility and check mobility.
• Suture for any soft tissue wounds.
• Extraction is a treatment of choice for significantly traumatized primary/deciduous teeth
with mobility and or displacement.
Reduction of fractures  
In reducing fractures, the object is to rearrange the bone ends as accurately as possible. Although  
the surgeon should attempt to get perfect reduction, the aim is to treat not a radiograph, but a 
patient, and where displacement is acceptable and function is not impaired the patient should not be 
subjected to unnecessary surgery.  
Open reduction and rig id internal fixation (ORIF)  
It is a standard treatment for most facial fractures. The technique relies on exposing the fractures 
through intra -or extra oral incisions and accurate reduction of the bony fractures, which are then 
held rigidly in place by th e application of titanium plates for facial fractures,2 mm used in mandibular 
fractures, 1.7 mm (low profile) and 1 mm used in mid - third fractures.  
Intermaxillary fixation (IMF)  
The mandible is immobilized by fixing it to the maxilla using arch bars and  flexible wires of different 
sizes 0.5, 0.6, 0.7 and 0.8mm. This establishes the occlusion and is an accepted part of the 
treatment of maxillary fractures. It may be employed in mandibular fractures, particularly when one 
or both condyles are involved.  362	Note 
Give tetanus toxoid (0.5% IU) if the patient has not received vaccination in the past 10 years.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Pain control by analgesics  
A: paracetamol (PO) 1g 8hourly for 3days  
OR 
C: diclofenac (PO) 50mg 8hourly for 3days 
OR 
A: ibuprofen (PO) 400mg 8hourly for 3days  
Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated in cases of suspected contamination or extensive damage 
B: ampicillin + cloxacillin (FDC) (PO) 500mg 8hourly for 5days  
16.12 Tumours and Tumour -Like Conditions of Oral Cavi ty and Facial Region  
16.12.1 Benign Odontogenic Tumors  
Each tumour presents with different cardinal features radiologically and on histopathological 
diagnosis.  
16.12.1.1Ameloblastoma  
Clinical Presentation  
• Recognized between ages of 10 to 80 years
• 80% form in the mandible and 70% develop in the posterior molar region and often involve
the ramus
• Painless, slow growing tumor that may be solid or cystic
• Loosening of teeth, with roots resorpti on
• Gradual facial asymmetry due to enlargement and destruction of bon e
• Continuous sheet of paper -thin bone covering the tumor
Investigation  
Radiographically, the tumour presents with multilocular radiolucency, honeycomb, or soap bubble appearance.  
Note 
Diagnostic confirmation of this tumour is through histopathology. Comp lete excision e.g. total 
resection of the jaw, segmental resection plus bone grafting is the treatment of choice. Hence refer 
the patient to a centre where there is oral and maxillofacial surgeon and histopathology Unit.
Calcifying odontogenic tumors  
Clinical Presentation  
• Most often found in the mandibular molar/premolar region, but 33% of cases are found in
the maxilla
• It is associated with an unerupted or impacted tooth in 50% of cases
Investigation  
Radiographically these lesions can be radiolucent, b ut more characteristically are mixed lucent and 
opaque masses, exhibiting a snow -driven appearance 
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Complete excision of the tumour with border of normal lobe should be curative, but recurrence 
follows incomplete excision.  363	16.12.1.2 A melobastic F ibroma  
Clinical Presentation  
• Slower growing tumor than the simple ameloblastoma and does not infiltrate between bone
trabeculae
• 75% of ameloblastic fibromas are found in the posterior mandible in the area of a
developing tooth. It is  benign and expansile, growing as a pushing front rather t han
invading surrounding tissues
Investigation  
Radiographically this lesion appears as a uniocular or bilocular radiolucency, most often in the 
posterior mandible. The radiographic appearance is id entical to that of unicystic ameloblastoma, and 
both lesions should be differential diagnoses because they affect similar age groups and have 
similar clinical and radiographic appearances. Histologic examination differentiates the two.  
Non-pharmacological  Treatment  
Conservative resection is effective, but if incomplete, recurrence follows  
16.12.1.3. Adenomatoid T umors (Adenoameloblastoma)  
Clinical Presentation  
• Two thirds of the cases occur in the anterior maxilla, one third occur in the anterior
mandible,  and it is never found posterior to the premolars
• Two thirds of the cases are associated with an impacted tooth (usually the cuspid)
• Present with mild swelling or in association with a clinically missing tooth
Investigation  
Radiographically this lesion g enerally appears as a well -demarcated radiolucency. In 75% of cases, 
it is associated with an unerupted tooth, usually the canine. It may contain radiopaque flecks, which 
represent calcified material.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Enucleation is curative  and recurrence is almost unknown.  
16.12.1.4 Odontogenic M yxoma 
Clinical Presentation  
• Clinically indistinguishable from ameloblastoma
• The radiographic appearance of this lesion is not distinctive. It appears quite lik e
ameloblastoma (eg multilocular radio lucency) .
Investigation  
Confirmation is through histopathology 
Non-pharmacological treatment  
Wide excision is required.  
16.12.2 Non Odontogenic Benign Tumours  
 (Benign Osteogenic Tumours, Arise from Bone)  
16.12.2.1 Ewing’s tumor  
Clinical presentation  
• Painful swelling accompanied with fever .
• It is characterized by extraordinarily fast growth.
Investigation  
Radiographically poorly defined solitary osteolytic lesion, irregular moth– eaten appearance which 
may be undetectable in serial images for a long per iod. Histological diagnosis is needed.  364	Pharmacological and Non-p harmacological Treatment 
The initial treatment is wide excision, if not possible radiation should be considered. Combination 
chemotherapy should be given.  
16.12.2.2 Pregnancy Tumours  
Clinic al presentation  
• They most commonly appear after first trimester, grow rapidly, and typically regress after
delivery.
• Found on the gingiva and arise predominantly.
• They are exophytic, lobulated, or smooth surfaced lesion with a red to purplish color and a
soft, spongy texture.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Surgical intervention is often not required. However, pregnancy tumors can be removed during the 
second trimester if they interfere with occlusion, are painful, bleed excessively, or are excessively large . Lesions excised during pregnancy often recur. After delivery, pregnancy tumors typically 
recede spontaneously but excision may be necessary for those cases which persist. Other non -
odontogenic tumors are Osteomas, Myxomas, Chondromas, Central giant cell and Fibro -osteoma.  
16.12.3 Benign Soft Tissues Non -Odontogenic Tumours  
Haemangioma  
Clinical presentation  
• Enlarged, vascular hamartoma appears as a painless, soft, smooth, or lobulated, sessile,
or pedunculated mass but may ulcerate and possibly hemorrhage if traumatized
• The lesions present with deep red or bluish red in color and moderately firm to palpation.
• May occur on tongue, lips, buccal mucosa, gingiva, palatal mucosa, salivary glands,
alveolar ridge, and jawbone.
• They occur early in life and may e nlarge rapidly or progressively as the patient grows.
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
Surgery can be beneficial if the lesion is small and has  no risk of excessive bleeding. The potential 
for s
evere hemorrhage caused by the vascular nature of the lesion must be considered. 
Non-p harmacological
 Treatment of benign tumors 
Enucleation or excision is the treatment of choice depending on the type. Can be hemi 
mandibulectomy, total mandibulectomy, hemi maxillectomy or total maxillectomy. Followed with 
reconstructi on w hen necessary. 
Pharmacological T reatment 
S: bleomycin injection intralesional (sclerotherapy) under ultrasound guidance to cause 
sclerosis of tissues. Surgery may follow if deemed necessary.  
16.12.4 Malignant Soft and Bone 
Tumours 16.12.4.1 Squamous cell carcinoma 
Clinical presentation 
• A sore in the mouth that does not heal (most common symptom).
• Pain in the mouth.
• Persistent lump or thickening of mucosa in the cheek.
• Persistent white or red patch on the tongue, gums, tonsils, or lining of the mouth.
• Difficult moving jaw or tongue.
• Difficult chewing or swallowing.
• Enlarged cervical lymph nodes may be present.365	Note  
Take tissue biopsy of the lesion and send for histopathology investigation or refer the patient as 
early as possible to a centre where the re is oral and maxillofacial surgeon and Histopathology unit.  
Treatment  
Palliative; but this depends on stage of the tumor: stage I and II surgical excision (squamous cell 
carcinoma) with wide margin then curative radiotherapy. Others, surgical excision, radiotherapy 
followed by chemotherapy.  
16.12.4.2 Lymphomas  
These are group of neoplasms of varying degrees of malignancy which are derived from B -cells of 
lymphoid tissues, the lymphocytes and histiocytes in any of their developmental stages.  
Burkitt’s l ymphoma (African Jaw Lymphoma) 
Clinical presentation  
• It shows close association and infection with the Epstein Barr virus. Confined almos t
exclusively to children between 2 –14years of age.
• Rapidly growing tumor mass of the jaws, destroying the bone and ca using teeth loosening
with extension the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses as well as the orbit.
• Visceral organ involvement also occurs.
Note  
Diagnostic confirmation is through histopathology; hence, it is emphasized to do early detection 
and referral since Burkitt’s lymphoma responds very quickly on chemotherapy. (For detailed management of malignant tumors please refer to the malignancy on chapter twenty -two)
16.12.5. Odontogenic and Non - Odontogenic Cysts  
  Odontogenic cysts
A group of jaw cysts that are formed from tissues involved in odontogenesis (tooth development). 
Odontogenic cysts are closed sacs filled with fluid, and have a distinct membrane derived from rests of odontogenic epithelium.  
Non-odontogenic jaw cysts
A group of cysts arisin g from epithelial remnants of embryonic ducts left behind after embryonal 
facial and jaw development; they are located deep within the tissues in the region of former epithelial ridges, epithelial walls, and primary facial fissural and cleft structures. So me few examples of 
frequently encountered cysts I orofacial regions are:  
Dentigerous cyst  
Dentigerous cysts, also called follicular cysts, are slow -growing benign and non- inflammatory 
odontogenic cysts that are thought to be developmental in origin.  
Clinical presentation  
• Uninfected dentigerous cysts are painless and non - tender on palpation.
• Larger cysts cause a marked, smooth, rounded expansion of the bone, which may be
reduced to a thin layer of cortical plate.366	Investigation  
Radiographically, they usually present as a well -defined and unilocular radiolucency surrounding the 
crown of an unerupted or impacted tooth within the mandible.  
Radicular (Apical) cyst  
Radicular cyst is an inflammatory jaw cyst originating from epithelial remnants of the perio dontal 
ligament because of inflammation that is generally a consequence of pulp necrosis. The resulting 
cyst commonly involves the apex of the affected tooth either by dental caries or trauma.  
Investigation  
Take OPG or Skull X -ray, the cysts appear as ro unded, radiolucent areas sharply demarcated from 
normal. Apical periodontal cysts are associated with the roots of dead teeth bone by a thin, radiopaque, limiting line of compact or cortical bone.  
Non pharmacological treatment  
Dental cystectomy under loca l or general anesthesia.  
Globulomaxillary cyst  
The globulomaxillary cyst is a cyst that appears between a maxillary lateral incisor and the adjacent 
canine. The globulomaxillary cyst often causes the roots of adjacent teeth to diverge.  
Investigation  
It exhibits as an "inverted pear- shaped radiolucency" on radiographs, or X -ray films. 
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Dental cystectomy under local or general anesthesia.  
Dermoid Cyst 
Dermoid cysts are rare masses of the oral cavity derived from ectodermal ele ments. These are 
benign, slow -growing tumors that are typically asymptomatic but cause complications of inflammation 
or dysphagia, dystonia, and airway encroachment due to mass effects.  
Clinical presentation  
• Massive swelling of the floor of the mouth, whi ch had displaced the tongue cranially.
• Painless slowly growing cystic lesion in the sublingual and or submental spaces.
• A dentigerous cyst may be suspected where a tooth is missing from the arch without any
history of previous extraction.
Non-pharmacologi cal Treatment  
Enucleation through an external approach below the mandible or intraorally though an incision in the 
floor of the mouth.  
Ranular Cyst  
A mucous extravasation cyst involving a sublingual gland and is a type of mucocele found on the 
floor of th e mouth.  
Clinical presentation  
• Translucent, blue, dome -shaped, fluctuant swelling in the tissues of the floor of the mouth.
• The swelling is not fixed, may not show blanching, and is non -painful unless it becomes
secondarily infected.
• The usual location i s lateral to the midline, which may be used to help distinguish it from a
midline dermoid cyst.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Excision of sublingual salivary gland which is affected.  367	16:13 Management of Oral Conditions during Pregnancy  
The oral changes w hich are seen in pregnancy include gingivitis, gingival hyperplasia, pyogenic 
granuloma, and salivary changes. Gastric acid secretion and the reflux of the acid into the oral cavity 
leads to worsening of enamel erosion, increased caries risk, increased too th mobility and loss.  
For the first trimester (1 -12weeks)  
During the first trimester, it is recommended that the patients be scheduled to assess their current dental health, to inform them of the changes that they should expect during their pregnancies, a nd to 
discuss on how to avoid maternal dental problems that may arise from these changes.  
Recommendations  
Educate the patients about the maternal oral changes which occur during pregnancy.  
Emphasize strict oral hygiene instructions and thereby, plaque c ontrol.  
Limit dental treatment to a periodontal prophylaxis, normal filling, and emergency treatments only.  
Avoid routine radiographs. They should be used selectively and only whenever they are needed.  
For the second trimester (13 -24weeks)  
During the seco nd trimester, the organogenesis is complete, and the risk to the foetus is low. The 
mother has also had time to adjust to her pregnancy, and the foetus has not grown to a potentially 
uncomfortable size that would make it difficult for the mother to remain still for long periods.  
Recommendations 
Maintenance of oral hygiene and plaque control. 
It’s safe to perform scaling, polishing and curettage if necessary.  
Active oral diseases should be controlled.  
It’s safe to perform elective procedures i.e. Root canal , extraction, restorations.  
Avoid routine radiographs. Use selectively and when they are needed.  
For the third trimester (25 -40weeks)  
The fetal growth continues and the focus of the concern now, is the risk to the upcoming birth 
process and the safety and comfort of the pregnant woman. It is safe to perform a routine dental 
treatment in the early part of the 3rd trimester.  
Recommendations 
Maintenance of oral hygiene and plaque control. 
It’s safe to perform scaling, polishing and curettage if necessary.  
Active oral diseases should be controlled.  
It’s safe to perform elective procedures.  
The radiograph use should be minimized.  
Procedures not to be performed after mid time of the third trimester.  
Note  
Pregnancy should not be considered as an absolute reason to deny required dental care. Pregnant 
patients must be educated about the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene, expected 
changes in the oral cavity and routine dental visits.  
16.14 Temporal Mandibular Disorder and Chronic Orofacial Pain  
Temporom andibular disorders (TMD) are disorders of the jaw muscles, temporomandibular joints, 
and the nerves associated with chronic facial pain. 
16.14.1 Chronic Orofacial Pai n other than Temporomandibular D isorders  
16.14.1.1 Trigeminal Neuralgia  
A sudden, usua lly unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more 
branches of the fifth cranial nerve. 368	Clinical presentation  
• Episodes of severe, shooting, or stabbing pain that may feel like an electric shock.
• Spontaneous attacks  of pain triggered by things such as touching the face, chewing,
speaking, or brushing teeth.
• Pain in areas supplied by the trigeminal nerve, including the cheek, jaw, teeth, gums, lips,
or less often the eye and forehead.
• Pain affecting one side of the face at a time.
Note  
For details of the Investigation and treatment refer a chapter eight (Central Nervous 
System).  
16.14.1.2 Persistent Idiopathic Orofacial P ain (a Typical Facial Pain, a Typical O dontalgia)  
A persistent facial pain that does not have th e characteristics of the cranial neuralgias and is not 
attributed to another disorder.  
Clinical presentation  
• Poorly localized deep pain that does not follow anatomically defined patterns.
• Patients may have had multiple dental treatments to try and remove the pain .
• There is a female preponderance in the third to fourth decades.
Investigation  
Thorough clinical history and examination  
Take radiographs of the dentition preferable OPG  
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Irreversible or invasive procedures should not be undertaken on teeth to try and relieve the pain if the 
clinical picture, vitality testing or radiographic examination would not support the procedure.  
Pharmacological Treatment  
A: amitriptyline (PO) 25mg nocte 24hourly for 1month. 
AND 
A: carbamez epine (PO) 100mg 8hourly for 1month. Dosage can be increased up to 300mg 
at the same frequency and duration.  
16.14.2 Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs)  
A collective term embracing several clinical problems that involve the masticatory musculature, the 
temporomandibular joint and associated structures, or both.  
Clinical presentation  
• Facial pain.
• Limitation of jaw motion.
• Muscle tenderness and stiffness.
• Along with any number of associated symptoms in the head, face, and neck region.
Non-pharmacologica l Treatment  
Reassurance and counseling  
Provide counseling to the patient on the natural history and course of temporomandibular disorders, 
the role of stress and parafunctional habits such as clenching and grinding of the teeth, the 
frequency of the problem in the population, and the self -limited nature of the disorder.  
Heat application  
Application of heat to the sides of the face with a heating pad, hot towel, or hot -water bottle. Vigorous 
treatment may be achieved with ultrasound or short -wave diathermy  heat treatments, which are 
widely available in physiotherapy units.  369	Fabrication of Intraoral Occlusal Orthotic A ppliances  
These devices are worn on the teeth like a retainer or a removable denture and are usually made of 
processed, hard acrylic.  
Physiotherapy  
Perform manual manipulation, massage, and ultrasonography, which are helpful in reconditioning 
and retraining the masticatory and the other cranio -cervical muscles that are usually involved in 
temporomandibular disorders.  
Pharmacological Treatment  
A: amitriptyline (PO) 25mg nocte for 1month. 
If the treatment is successful, maintenance dose should be given for 2 -4months.

17.2 Inflammatory Conditions  
These are a group of diverse inflammat ory conditions due to different causes which affect joints and 
other musculoskeletal tissues.  
General Guidelines  
•The first -line treatment is a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID). This group
includes medicines like aspirin, diclofenac and Ibupro fen, (provide dosage and scientific
proof) but does NOT include paracetamol
•NSAIDs should be used cautiously in pregnancy, the elderly, and patients with asthma and
liver or renal impairment.
•NSAIDS should be avoided in patients with bleeding disorders
•NSAIDS increases the risk of heart failure and stroke and should be avoided in patients with
cardiovascular diseases and those who are at high risk
•NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with current or past peptic ulceration.
•NSAIDs should be taken with foo d
•If dyspeptic symptoms develop in a patient on NSAIDs, try adding magnesium trisilicate
mixture.  If dyspepsia persists and NSAID use considered essential antagonist
•Physiotherapy is a useful adjunct treatment in many inflammatory joint conditions
Referr al: For patients with serious rheumatic disease and peptic ulceration should be referred to 
higher level health facility with adequate expertise and facilities.  
17.2.1 Rheumatoid Arthritis

Nutritional support  
To prevent excessive accumulation of uric acid  
• Use of low purine diet by restricting consumption red meat, fish, alcohol, stim ulants,
and high protein foods to avoid exogenous addition of purines to the existing hi gh
uric acid load is recommended
• Encourage consumption of alkalizing foods e.g. lemons, tomatoes, green beans,
fruits and milk products 
• Intake of fluids about 3lts/day to enhance excretion of uric acid based on
assessment is recommended

17.51 Low Back Pain  
Low back  pain  is a com mon presenting  complaint  especially  among  the adult  population.  Severity 
may range from mild, transient symptom to chronic and disabling pain. Causes of low back pain are 
numerous  and clues  to the underlying  cause  can usually  be found  from  a good clinical  history  and 
physical  examination.  In some  patients  however,  no cause  will be found,  and these  people  are 
described as having nonspecific back pain.  
Clinical presentation 
Exclude specific causes of low back  pain, for example, suspected or confirmed maligna ncies, spine 
infection, spine tr auma o r inflammatory  disease s uch a s spondyloarthritis. (flag s igns) 
Acute lo w back pain (pain for <6 weeks’ duration) 
Investigations 
• Explain to people with acute low back pain with or without sciatica that their pain is lik ely to
resolve on analgesia and bed rest
• Do not routinely offer imaging for people with acute low back pain with or without sciatica in
absence of flag signs. Consider imaging only if the result is likely to change management.
Non-pharmacological Treatmen t 
Self-management:  Provide people with advice and information, tailored to their needs and 
capabilities, to help them self -manage their low back pain.

If untreated it causes long-term functional disability. The condition can vary in its degree of severity ranging from quite mild to very severe.  It may present with other defects such as spina bifida, arthrogryposis, multiplex congenita, congenital myotonic dystrophy, or diastrophic dysplasia.  Clinical presentation Birth deformities of the foot with  • Small foot and calf  • Cavus (tight intrinsics muscles) • Adductus of forefoot (tight tibialis posterior) • Varus (tight tendoachilles, tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior) • Equinus (tight tendoachilles) Diagnosis  • Most clinical diagnosis • Plain X-ray   Management   Non operative management - Ponseti method of serial manipulation and casting,  The goal is to rotate foot laterally around a fixed talus, order of correction follows acronym (CAVE) 1. Cavus 2. Adductus3.Varus4. Equinus. Heel cord tenotomy needed in at least 80-90% of children. Followed by Foot abduction orthosis (FAO). Non noncompliance to FAO is the biggest risk factor for deformity recurrence    Table 17:5: Ponseti Method Month 1-4 Weekly serial casting (with knee in 90° of flexion ) with forefoot supination, then forefoot abduction • First correct cavus with forefoot SUPINATED (NOT pronated) by aligning the less varus forefoot with the more varus hindfoot (pronation would increase cavus deformity)   • Secondly correct adduction and heel varus by rotating calcaneus and forefoot around talus (head of talus acts as a fulcrum) into forefoot ABDUCTION 395		Tendon Achilles lengthening (Tenotomy) (TAL) at week 8 required in > 80-90% • Equinus correction last with tendon Achilles tenotomy  • Perform when foot is at least 60° abducted, heel is in valgus and equinus persists   • Cast in maximal dorsiflexion for 3 weeks after tenotomy Month 4-8 Foot abduction orthosis (FAO)  • 23 hours a day for 3 months after correction  • night time/nap time only until age 4 years • With FAO holding affected feet at least 60°external rotation and 30° in normal foot for unilateral cases  • Feet are measured prior to tenotomy so FAO is available on the day of post-tenotomy cast removal 2-4 years Tibialis anterior tendon transfer (TA transfer)  at 2-5 yrs of age (30-50% will require) • 30-50% will need TA transfer with or without repeat TAL or gastrocnemius recession for recurrent deformity • Indicated if the patient demonstrates supination during gait Operative management  I. posteromedial soft tissue release and tendon lengthening for children of <2years  II. medial column lengthening or lateral column-shortening osteotomy, or cuboid decancellation indicated for children older than 2years III. talectomy-n severe, rigid recurrent clubfoot in children between 6-10yeras or those with arthrogryposis  Note Surgical management are complemented by serial casting and   foot adduction orthosis  17.7: Musculoskeletal Tumour  Musculoskeletal tumors are tumors that develop in muscles, bones and nerves Bone tumors are divided into primary and secondary (metastatic) tumours. Primary tumours arise from cells which constitute the bone and are divided into benign and malignant types. Metastatic type is most common cause of bone cancer, the most common primary sites being renal, thyroid, lung, prostate, and breast.  Clinical presentation • Dull and aching pain which worsen at night is deemed a ‘red flag’ symptom • Swelling where the tumor is located  • Pathological fracture  • Fever, weight loss, anemia and general body malaise are late symptoms   Note For detailed clinical presentations, investigations and management of specific bone tumor refer to malignancy chapter   17:8 Angular Deformity of Limbs 17.8.1 Rickets Refers to softening and weakening of bones in children, usually due to inadequate vitamin D. Vitamin D promotes the body’s absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Extreme or prolonged lack of vitamin D makes it difficult to maintain proper calcium and phosphorus levels in bones, which can cause rickets. Clinical presentation  • delayed growth,  • bow legs,  • weakness and pain in the spine,  • pelvis and leg 
396		Pharmacological Treatment  Treatment may involve adding vitamin D or calcium to the diet,    17.8.2 Physiological Bowing/Knocked Knees Is considered bending of knees at an early age due to early walking and overweight below the age of 2years  Diagnosis process I. Diagnosis is mainly by physical examination – obvious varus/valgus deformity and metaphysical widening. II. Blood tests to measure the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood (Refer to table 17:3.) III. Bone X-rays to check for bone deformities.  Treatment • First consultation: rule out if it’s physiological – bow legs at young age before the age of 3 years without signs of rickets • If it’s physiological then consider follow up every 6 months +/- vitamin d supplements • At the age of 3 years if deformity more than 8degrees consider–hemiepiphysiodesis at around the age of 3years if the deformity is due to Blount’s disease consider hemiepiphysiodesis/corrective osteotomy.  Note For details on specific surgical option kindly refer to standard orthopedic text books. 	
397		CHAPTER NINETEEN METABOLIC AND ENDOCRINE DISEASE CONDITIONS  19.1 Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes mellitus is a clinical syndrome characterized by persistently high blood glucose values due to deficiency or diminished effectiveness of insulin.   Classification Diabetes mellitus can be classified as follows:  • Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) – due to autoimmune β-cell destruction  • Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) – due to a progressive loss of β-cell insulin secretion frequently with underlying insulin resistance  • Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) – diabetes diagnosed in the second or third trimester of pregnancy that was not clearly overt diabetes prior to gestation  • Specific types of diabetes – due to other causes e.g., monogenic, diseases of the exocrine pancreas and drugs or chemicals.  Diagnostic Criteria  • Main clinical features of diabetes are thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, tiredness, loss of weight, blurring of vision.  • Many people have no classical symptoms and may only present late with the symptoms related to complications e.g., pruritus vulvae and balanitis due to infections, paraesthesia or pain in the limbs, non-healing ulcers, and recurrent bacterial infections.   WHO diagnostic Criteria 2006  • Fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL)  • Plasma glucose≥ 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load in a glucose tolerance test  • Symptoms of hypogycaemia and casual plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)  • Glycatedhemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%.   Diagnosis of gestational diabetes (WHO criteria 2013)  • Fasting plasma glucose 5.1–6.9 mmol/l  • 2–hour plasma glucose 8.5–11.0 mmol/l following a 75g oral glucose load.   Note Fasting plasma glucose higher than 6.9 mmol/l or 2–hour plasma glucose higher than 11.0 mmol/l are considered overt diabetes rather than GDM  At risk screening  Early diagnosis and good control reduce the risk of costly complications and reduces the deterioration of islet function in T2DM. The following people should therefore be screened with fasting blood glucose or HbA1c at least yearly when they visit health facilities:    • Those aged ≥40 years • Children and adults <40 years who are overweight or obese and who have two or more additional risk factors for diabetes • Individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose or a history of a cardiovascular event  • People on long-term steroids or immunosuppressants • Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus or polycystic ovary syndrome  • All pregnant women at the first antenatal visit if overweight, have had gestational diabetes, babies with birth weight >4 kg, previous stillbirths or neonatal deaths. Screening should be repeated in the second trimester if negative. • All women during the 2nd or 3rd trimester (for gestational diabetes).  Impaired glucose tolerance For people with glucose intolerance the risk of T2DM and its associated mortality may be reduced by: 	
398		• dietary modification (see chapter on Nutrition) • physical activity (see chapter on Nutrition)   • weight reduction • medication with metformin.  Goals of diabetes management Table 19.1: Goals for Optimum Management Of Diabetes Diet Advise same as for people without diabetes Body mass index  Therapeutic goal is 5–10% weight loss for people who are overweight or obese, but aim for BMI<25 kg/m2 Waist circumference  <102 cm for men, <88 cm for women  Physical activity  At least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most days of the week (total ≥150 minutes/week) Cigarette consumption  0 per day Alcohol consumption   Not more than 2 standard unit  drinks (20 g) per day for men and 1 unit for women Blood glucose level  Non-pregnant: 4–6 mmol/L fasting; 6–8 mmol/L postprandial     Pregnant: ≤5.0 mmol/L fasting, ≤6.7 mmol/L postprandial Self-monitoring of blood glucose is essential to improve outcomes   HbA1c  Target ≤7% (6.5–7.5%). Should be measured every three months until stable, thereafter at least twice a year Lipids  Total cholesterol: <5.2 mmol/L HDL-C: ≥1.0 mmol/L LDL-C: <2.6 mmol/L Triglycerides: <1.7 mmol/L Blood pressure   Target ≤140/90 mmHg For those with albuminuria/proteinuria <130/80 mmHg   Urine albumin  Spot collection: <20 mg/L   Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR): women: <3.5 mg/mmol; men: <2.5 mg/mmol 399	Algorithm for the Glycemic Management of T2DM 
Non-pharmacological Management 
Healthy lifestyles  
Dietary control 
•Objectives:
oTo meet requirements for growth and development, physical activity, and
maintenance of desirable body weight. Majority of people with T2DM are overweight
or obese and need to lose weight.
oAttain and maintain near normal blood glucose levels to prevent hypo - and
hyperglycaemia and so minimize the onset of chronic complications.
oAttain optimum blood lipids and blood pressure control and so reduce the risk ofmacrovascular disease.

üA lower fat intake of up to 20% or less of the daily energy in caseof obese adult with diabetes.
oLimit salt to less than 1 teaspoonful/day
oLimit fat intake
•Physical activity
oAerobic (e.g. brisk walking) and muscle strengthening activities improve glucosetolerance, energy expenditure, feeling of wellbeing and mood, work capacity, improved
blood pressure, lipid profiles and increased functional mobility in older people.
oAdjust medicine dosages and or food intake to avoid hypoglycaemia.
•No smoking
•Avoid or limit alcohol intake to one drink/day for women, two drinks/day for men.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Treatment with oral hypoglycemics 
•Review the blood glucose at follow -up cl inic and adjust medicines as needed until blood
glucose is controlled.
•If lifestyle measures on their own failure achieve blood glucose control or blood glucose
levels are persistently high (fasting >11 mmol/l or random >15 mmol/l) initiate:
67267 
A: metfo rmin (PO) 500mg 12hourly with or after meals. Increase, as required, until a 
maximum of 2000mg in 2 –3 divided doses.  
If Metformin is contraindicated, then use  
A: glibenclamide (PO) 2.5 –10mg 12hourly 
OR   
C: glimepiride (PO) 1 –4mg 12hourly 
OR 
A: gliclazide (PO) 40 –160mg 12hourly 
•If the maximum dose of metformin does not result in adequate glycaemic control, either oneof the above sulphonylureas may be added, starting with the lower dose and increasing until
control is achieved or the maximum dose i s reached.
•If a combination of both medicines is still inadequate, then insulin should be added as
detailed below in the section on insulin.
•Activity of sulphonylureas is prolonged in both hepatic and renal failure
•Metformin is contraindicated in  those with severe renal, liver and cardiac failure.
•The lower dosage is appropriate when initiating treatment in elderly patients with
uncertain meal schedules, or in patients with mild hyperglycemia
•Sulphonylureas are best taken 15 to 30 minutes before m eals
Treatment with Insulin Injection in Type 2 Diabetes  
Insulin injections are indicated in T2DM in the following conditions:  Note 401	•Initial presentation with fasting blood glucose more than 15 mmo l/l
•Presentation in hyperglycaemic emergency
•Peri-operative period especially major or emergency surger y
•Other medical conditions requiring tight glycaemic control
•Organ failure: Renal, liver, heart etc,
•Diabetes not well controlled with diet or oral drugs
•Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA)
•Contraind ications to oral drugs
Note  
The maximum glucose lowering efficacy of oral drugs is usually evident by six months. 
Therefore, the efficacy of any added therapy must be assessed within six months and 
an alternative drug instituted in case of failure  
Insulin injections should be initiated by a doctor able to fully instruct the patient in its use but insulin 
will be available at lower health facilities for management of stable patients who require 
prescription refills.

Pre-mixed insulin A: Intermediate and shor t acting 
insulin (70/30)  Basal + Short acting 
Insulin as substitution therapy  
Oral medicines are discontinued (except metformin if patient is obese)  
S: Pre-mixed insulin is introduced at a dosage of 0.2 IU/kg body weight and this is split    into: 
⅔ in the morning and ⅓ in the evening  
• Inject 30 minutes before the morning and the evening meals for human insulins
• Inject 0 to 15minutes before meal for analog insulins .
Insulin as supplemental therapy  
Oral medicines are continued  
A: neutral protamine hagedorn (isophane) insulin administered at night before 22:00h at a total 
daily dose of 0.1 –0.2 IU/kg body weight.  
• The oral medicines are continued (half maximum dose of sulphonylureas and
metformin dose of 2 g/day)
• Blood glucose levels are monitored.
Self-monitoring in patients with T2DM   
Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG) is usually recommended in the following patients: 
•patients on insulin and glucose lowering agents that can cause hypoglycaemi a
(sulphonylureas )
•when monitoring hyperglycaemia ar ising from illness
•with pregnancy and pre -pregnancy planni ng
•when changes in treatment, lifestyle or other conditions requires data on glycaemic
patterns
•when HbA1c estimations are unreliable (eg haemoglobinopathies)
 TYPE 1 Diabetes Mellitus (Childhood 
diabetes) Non-pharmacological Treatment 
•Nutrition (refer to nutrition chapter)
•Exercise requirements are as for children without diabetes
•Psychological support is important to cope with this chronic illness.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Total dose of insu lin contains soluble and intermediate/long -acting insulin. 402	•Give total dose of insulin
opre puberty 0.5 IU/kg/day subcutaneously for lif e
opuberty 1- 2 IU/kg/day subcutaneously for lif e
oafter puberty < 2 IU/kg/day subcutaneously for life
•Divide total insul in dose as per recommended percentage below

Time Type of insulin  Proportion 
Break -fast Short acting 30% of total daily dose 
Lunch Short acting  20% of total daily dose  
Supper  Short acting  10% of total daily dose  
Bedtime  Long/intermediate acting 40% of total daily dose  
Note  
•Diabetes in children is often misdiagnosed as some other condition – e.g. as pneumonia or
asthma (laboured breathing),
•Insulin should be given for life and the dose adjusted according to w eight and glucose response
•Self-glucose monitoring by glucometer at home 3 -4times/day
•Pre-mixed insulins not advised in children

Surgery in d iabetes  
General measures  
Correct pre -operative management depends on type of surgery (major or minor), type of diabetes 
and recent diabetes control.  
•Surgery should be delayed if possible if HBA1C >9% or blood glucose fasting >10 mmol/l or
random gl ucose > 13 mmol/l.
•Screen for nephropathy, cardiac disease, retinopathy and neuropathy and inform surgicalteam
.
If diabetes is well controlled and surgery is minor:  
•If on diet or oral agent therapy, omit therapy on morning of surgery and resume therapy
when eating normally
•For T1DM, continue with normal dose of insuli n403	If on insulin therapy or poor glycaemic control or major surgery: 
•Use continuous IV insulin infusion
•Start at 8 am and stop when eating normally.
•Monitor blood glucose before, during  and after surgery: aim for blood glucose levels of 6 –10
mmol/l.
For major surgery (glucose -insulin potassium regimen) 
•Once snack is missed, start an IV regimen irrespective of the size of the procedure
•Maintain insulin administration (hourly) to avoid lipolysis and ketoacidosis in patients with
restricted oral intake and thus prevent DKA
•Administer 5% dextrose in maintenance IV fluids AND
•Short -acting insulin (16 Units) + KCl 10mmol/L added to 500mls of 10% dextrose.
o Infuse at 80ml/hr IV .
o If obese or initial blood glucose is high (>14mmo/l) consider higher dose of insulin ( 20
Units)
o If very thin or usual insulin dose is very low, consider lower dose (12 Units)
•Monitor blood glucose levels hourly (aim for 6– 10 mmo/l)
o If blood glucose is low or fall ing reduce dose by 4 Units
o If blood glucose is high or raising increase dose by 4 Units
•Patients receiving Multiple Daily Insulin Therapy (MDIT) should receive preoperative basal
insulin dose without interruption in the perioperative period. When oral int ake is restricted,
regular insulin may be given every 4 –6 hrs to control hyperglycemia. When a diet is
tolerated, the MDIT regimen should be resumed
•Post operatively: give 5 –10% dextrose IV 1 litre + KCl 20ml + 2/3 of total daily dose of
insulin over 8hrs  and repeat until able to take orally. Continue the infusion until 60 minutes
after the first meal.
•Resume usual therapy after first meal
•Check electrolytes daily.
19.2 Management of Diabetes During Religious Fasting  
There are several types of fasting:  
•Normal fast (the common fast): the person abstains from all foods but can take water for alimited time.
•Total fast = total abstinence from both food and water. This should not go beyond 
a
maximum of three days and is not recommended for those people takin g insuli n
secretagogues or insulin.
•Partial fast = abstain from selected foods and drinks, or omit a certain meal each of thefasting days.
Those with very poor glucose control should be discouraged from fasting 
•A total fast is not recommended for anyo ne with diabetes. Adequate hydration is important
even during the period of fasting.
•For those on insulin, a partial fast is preferred to total or normal forms of fasting.
•Self-blood glucose monitoring is mandatory for people with diabetes who elect to f ast.
oOnce -a-day is adequate for patients on diet only or diet with metformin.
oAt least 3 times a day in patients on insulin secretagogues
oMore frequently if hyperglycaemia is marked and the urine tested for ketones.
•Consider terminating the fast if freque nt hypoglycaemia or intercurrent infections.
•Vigorous activity should be avoided during period of fast.
•Ensure ready access to a healthcare provider during the period of fast.
Management of normal fasting for people treated with oral hypoglycaemic agen ts 
•Fasting is possible in this situation.
•Usual dietary advice should be followed at this time.
•Patients on metformin, alpha- glucosidase inhibitors and thiazolidinediones (glitazones) c
an
continue taking the usual doses at the usual times.
•If on a secon d or third generation sulphonylurea (glibenclamide, gliclazide, glipizide,
glimepiride), this should be taken at the time of breaking the fast and not before dawn.404	Management of normal fasting for T2DM patients on insulin 
•If on once daily insulin befor e bed, this can be given as usual
•If on twice daily short - and intermediate- acting insulin:
o Before the dawn meal, give the usual evening dose of short -acting insulin without any
intermediate -acting insulin.
o Before the evening meal give the usual morning dose of short -acting and
intermediate -acting insulin.
•If on basal bolus regimen:
oUsual doses of the short -acting insulin can be given before the dawn and eveni ng
meals, and usual doses of the intermediate- acting insulin can still be given at 10pm.
oRegula r SBGM is essential to ensure prevention of hypoglycaemia
oTitration of doses should occur according to SBGM results.
•Neither the insulin injection nor the breaking of the skin for SBGM will break the fast.

19.3 Hyperglycaemia in Pregnancy  
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is any degree of glucose intolerance first recognized in 
pregnancy. Diabetes in pregnancy refers to tho se with pre- existing diabetes, whether diagnosed or 
not. 
Screening at first antenatal visit 
•Perform screening in all women at the first antenatal clinic attendance if they have:
oBMI > 25 kg/m2
oprevious history of GDM
oprevious big baby
opoor obstetric h istory
ofamily history of DMoknown impaired glucosetolerance/impaired fastingglucose.
ogrand multipara
oglycosuria.
•Women in early pregnancy with levels of HbA1c ≥6.5% or blood glucose levels fasting ≥7.0
mmol/l or two hours ≥11.1 mmol/l which are diagno stic of diabetes should be treated a
s
having pre- existing diabetes.
•Women with HbA1c 6.0 –6.4%, fasting glucose 5.1 – 6.9 mmol/l or two -hour glucose 8.6 –11.0
mmol/l should be assessed to determine the need for immediate home glucose monitoringand, if the d iagnosis remains unclear, assessed for gestational diabetes by 75 g oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) at 24– 28 weeks.
Screening later in Pregnancy 
•All women with risk factors (see above) should have a 75 g OGTT at 24 –28 weeks
•A fasting plasma glucose at 24 –28 weeks is recommended in low -risk women
Non-pharmacological Treatments 
•All women intending to become pregnant should:405	oBe encouraged to achieve excellent glycaemic control using glucose monitoring of both
fasting and postprandial values
oBe pre scribed high -dose (5mg) pre- pregnancy folate supplementation, continuing up t o
12 weeks’ gestation
oHave an eye exam and be informed of the risk of developing and/or progression ofdiabetic retinopathy
oHave a kidney assessment (random urine albumin/creatini ne ratio and serum
creatinine) and referred if urine protein ≥ 1g.
•A combined health -care team (obstetrician, diabetologist or internist, diabetes educator,
pediatrician/neonatologist) is required.
•Review SMBG, blood pressure and urine protein and ketones by dipstick at each visit 
and
eye examination in each trimester.
•Target glycaemia:
oPreprandial blood glucose 3.5 –5.5mmol/L
oPostprandial blood glucose 5 –7.5mmol/L
•Lifestyle management is the preferred means of managing gestational diabetes.
oDiet is based on the principles of optimal nutrition and controlled weight gain.
oExercise can be helpful in lowering BG levels: the most acceptable form of exercise for
most women is walking in their normal daily routine.
•Glucose -lowering therapy should be considered in addition to diet where fasting or two
hours glucose levels are above target, for example, where two or more values per fortnight
are:
ofasting or preprandial ≥ 5.5 mmol/L, or two hours postprandial ≥ 7 mmol/L at ≤ 35 weeks
ofasting or preprandial ≥ 5.5 mmol/L , or two hours postrandial ≥ 8 mmol/L at >35 weeks
oany postprandial values are >9 mmol/L.
•When pharmacologic treatment of gestational diabetes is indicated, insulin and oral
medications are equivalent in efficacy, and either can be an appropriate first -line therapy.
Pharmacological Treatment 
A: metformin 500 mg 12hourly, maximum 2000mg in 2 –3 doses 
OR 
A: glibenclamide 2.5mg 24hourly to a maximum of 10mg daily 
Note  
Oral hypoglycaemics (except for metformin and glibenclamide) are contraindicated in pregn ancy 
Insulin  
The rapid -acting insulin analogs (lispro and aspart) lower postprandial blood glucose and decrease 
the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Patients on lispro and aspart prior to conception may continue 
them during pregnancy. Patients on regular  insulin may be switched to lispro or aspart if 1 –hour 
postprandial blood glucose levels are above target and/or the patient is also experiencing pre -meal 
or nocturnal hypoglycemia.  
Postnatal Follow Up 
•Women with gestational diabetes should be screened at 6– 12 weeks postnatal to ensur e
return to normal glucose tolerance. Thereafter, a 1 –2 yearly follow up is recommended.
•Metformin and glibenclamide may be used even if a woman is breastfeeding.  Encourage
women to breastfeed.
•If retinopathy, che ck eyes 1 year postpartum
19.4 Diabetes and HIV  
The management of people with both diabetes and HIV need to consider the following:  
•ARVs are associated with increased metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance,dyslipidemia and lipodystr
ophy
•Protease inhibitors (PIs) increase insulin resistance and reduce insulin secretion byinterfering with GLUT –4 mediated glucose transport
•Standards of treatment and management of diabetes for patients with HIV are generally thesame as those for diabetic  patients without HIV and patients who acquire HIV may conti
nue
to be managed with the same drug therapy as before406	•Sulfonylureas may not be effective in the face of severe insulin resistance. In case glycemic
control deteriorates, insulin should be initia ted, rather than increasing dosage or number o f
oral medications
•People who are on ARTs need to be screened for diabetes at least once a year andespecially if they have other CVD risk factors
19.5 Diabetes and Tuberculosis  
Diabetes and tuberculosis are interlinked as follows:  
•People attending TB clinics should be screened for diabetes and those attending diabetes
clinics should be screened for TB if presenting with symptoms.
•Diabetes may be associated with delayed sputum conversion (>60 days), higher p robability
of tuberculosis treatment failure, higher recurrence and relapse rates, higher overallmortality, higher rates of multi -drug resistance TB and more atypical presentation i
n
hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic coma or ketoacidosis
•For both con ditions, controlling blood sugar, being more physically active, avoiding chronic
stress, getting enough sleep and maintaining ideal weight are recommended.
Review Drug Requirements 
•Rifampicin is a potent hepatic enzyme -inducing agent, accelerates the me tabolism of ora l
hypoglycemic agents and shortens the plasma half -life of sulphonylureas
•Isoniazid antagonizes sulphonylureas, impairs insulin release and action and leads to
increased requirement of insulin and oral antidiabetic medication
•Therefore, pe ople with diabetes may require an increase in dosage of antidiabetic
medication if they develop tuberculosis.
Use Oral Antidiabetic Medicines Carefully in Tuberculosis 
•People with diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis should be treated with insulin injecti on, or i n
case a diabetic with tuberculosis is on oral hypoglycemic agents, it may be necessary to
switch to insulin.
•Tuberculosis affects both the liver and pancreas: oral antidiabetic drugs are contraindicat ed
in hepatic disease, which is a common adver se effect of antituberculous therapy.
•Metformin produces weight loss, particularly in high doses, and it is also an anorectic.
•Marked weight loss and higher insulin and caloric needs in tuberculosis are other important
indications for reviewing oral anti diabetic therapy in diabetes mellitus.
19.6 Hypoglycaemia  
Hypoglycaemia is defined as blood glucose <3.9mmol/L. 
Diagnostic Criteria 
•Hunger
•Sweating
•Trembling or shaki ng
•Anxiety
•Dizziness
•Lightheadedness
•Palpitation•Numbness around the lips a nd fingers
•Headache
•Confusion
•Lack of concentrati on
•Weakness
•Changes in behaviour (e.g. irritability,
tearfulness, crying), paraesthesiae .
Patients may  also present with convulsions, seizures or coma due to delayed corrective action or 
impaired h ypoglycaemi a awareness wher e the patient loses t he abilit y to detect t he early 
symptom s of hypoglycaemia due to repeated episode s of m ild hy poglycaemia or long duration of 
diabetes leadi ng to loss of adrenergic and gluc agon response, wit h eventual loss of ad renergic and 
neuroglycopaenic symptoms.  
Non-pharmacological 
Treatment for conscious Patients: 
Quickly take a glass of a sugar -rich drink 
OR  
Eat one table spoon of sugar or honey 
AND 
Have a meal. 407	If symptoms persist after 5 minutes repeat the above.  
Treatment for unconscious Patients:  
C: 50% dextrose (IV) (40 –50ml) 
OR 
C: 10% dextrose (IV) (200 –300ml).  
• Repeat if patient is not responsive or if after 15 minutes, the blood glucose is
still below 4mmol/l.
• Follow by 8 –10 % glucose infusion. Use 5% dextrose if the higher
concentrations are not available.
OR  
S: glucagon (IM or SC) 1mg stat  
Note  
 If IV access is impossible, consider nasogastric tube or rectal glucose 
On Recovery  
•Give long -acting carbohydrate snack e.g. a piece of br ead
•Identify the ca use of hypoglycaemia and correct it
•If hypoglyceamia is a result of long acting suphonylureas, long - or intermediate acting insulin or
alcohol, frequently monitor blood glucose (2hourly) and give IV dextrose infusion (5 –10%) for 12 –
24 hours
•If patient is not responding look for another cause or refer.
19.7 Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic States  
These are acute metabolic complications of diabetes mellitus that may lead to severe dehydration, 
altered level of consciousness and electrol yte imbalance. The presence of acidosis, ketonemia and 
ketonuria in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) differentiates it from hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS).  
Symptoms 
•Nausea/vomiting
•Shortness of breath
•Obtundation/drowsiness
•Thirst/polyuri
a
•Fruity smellingbreath
•Confusion•Abdominal pain
•Fever
•Altered mental function
•Dehydration
•Lethargy
•Coma
Note  
• When you suspect DKA, confirm diagnosis immediately
• All patients minimum should be admitted in hospital for intensive management

DKA and HHS Treatment  
Treatment of DKA and HHS is similar.  
•Frequent monitoring of patients
•Improvement of circulatory volume and tissue perfusion408	•Replacement of electrolyte losses (potassium)
•Administration of insulin
•Careful search and management of the precipitating causes
With proper treatment, the average time to resolution is between 10 –18 hours for DKA and ~9 –11 
hours for HHS.  
I. Fluid management protocol
•The first step - infusion of isotonic saline to expand extracellular volume and stabilize
cardiovascular status. Fluid replacement alone results in:
oImprovement of hyperglycemia, reduce insulin resistance
olowering the plasma osmolality ,
oreducing vasoconstriction and improving perfusion,
orestores renal perfusion
oReduce insulin resistance by ↓ stress/counterregulatory hormone level s
•Both DKA and HHS patients have severe volume depletion -- estimated water deficit of
100mls/kg body weight
•Usual initial fluid → isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl)
•Optimal rate of fluid infusion depends on the clinical s tate of the patient. On average
15 to 20 ml/kg/hour (about 1000 ml/hour) max. <50ml/kg in the first four hours .
For children  
oDetailed management of DKA is presented in the alogarithm for management of
paediatric diabetic ketoacidosis in low resourc e centre below.

Almost all patients with DKA or HHS have a substantial potassium deficit.
•Acidosis –shift to extracellular
•Urinary losses related to the glucose osmotic diuresis
•Secondary hyperaldosteronism.
•Loss is high 3 -10mEq/kg
Despite total body potassium deficit, concentration is usually normal or elevated due to  
•insulin deficiency and hyperosmolality
•both result in potassium movement out of the cells
•Insulin  treatment reverse distribution
Good approach checks ECG for signs of hyperkalemia (peaked T wave, QRS widening)  
•Give KCL if signs absent and if K <5.3
•If Patient oliguric give KCL when K <4 or ECG signs of hypokalemia (U wave)

Continuous IV infusion of regular insulin is the treatment of choice
•Correct hypovolemic shock and hypokalemia if present, before starting insulin
•Low dose IV insulin for both DKA and HHS
•Serum potassium <3.3 mEq/L only contraindication for insulin
IV regular/Soluble insulin and rapid -acting insuli n analogs are equally effective  
Insulin therapy   
•Lowers serum glucose concentration ( ↓ hepatic glucose production>> ↑ peripheral utilization)
•Diminishes ketone production (reducing both lipolysis and glucagon secretion)
•Augment ketone utilization.
Conv entional Insulin Guidelines  
Both HHS and moderate to severe DKA  
•IV bolus of regular insulin (0.1 U/kg body weight) followed within 5 minutes by a continuous
infusion of regular insulin of 0.1 U/Kg/hour = 7 U/hour in a 70 kg patient
•Alternatively, omit bol us dose →continuous IV infusion of regular insulin at a rate of 0.14 U/k g
per hour (equivalent to 10 U/hour in a 70 kg patient)
oBut bolus insulin is a priming dose, saturates insulin receptors full before continuousinsulin
oAvoid lag time in achieving steady state insulin levels
ü In practice -100iu in 100mls of NS titrate in 5 -7cc/h in the first 24hours
ü Or 60iu in 60mls of NS titrate 6 -7cc/hour in 24hours
•Insulin dosing same in DKA and HHS
•If plasma glucose does not decrease by 2.8 -4.2mmol/l in the first h our, increase the infusi
on
rate of insulin by 50% to 100%
•Optimal rate of glucose declines 5.5mmol/l/hour
•Glucose drop not allowed to less than 14mmol/l during first 4 -5hrs of treatment.
•It takes 12 -24 hours to clear ketones from circulation after hypergly cemia is controlled
19.8 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases 
Diabetic patients are 2– 4 times likely to develop cardiovascular diseases mainly due to 
atherosclerosis and hypertension.  
The clinical spectrum of cardiovascular diseases includes:  
•Coronary he art diseas e
•Angina (which may be silent)
•Acute coronary artery syndrome
•Congestive cardiac failure
•Sudden death
•Cerebral vascular accident (stroke, transient ischaemic attacks and dementia)
•Peripheral  vascular disease (intermittent claudication, foot ulcer and gangrene).
Assessment (annual) 
•ECG, Chest X -Ray, if with symptoms/signs of heart failure.
•Peripheral  vascular disease evaluation includes doppler and angiography of lower limbs.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Acute coronary syndrome  
All adults wi th T2DM and recent acute coronary syndrome and/or coronary stent should receive dual 
anti-platelet therapy for 12 months after the event or procedure:  
A: acetyl salicylic acid (PO) 75 –100mg 24hourly 
AND  
D: clopidogrel (PO) 75mg 24hourly 
Note  
•acetyl salicylic acid is also indicated for primary prevention for people with T2DM >40years with
family history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cigarette smoking, obesity, proteinuria, ordyslipidemia.
•It is contraindicated in peptic/duodenal ulcer, dyspepsia, h eartburn, malignant hypertension,
haemorrhagic stroke.411	Hyperlipidaemia 
Statin therapy results in a significant decrease in CVD morbidity and mortality in T2DM and are 
indicated in Type 2 diabetics > 40 years of age, or diabetes for > 10years  
B: atorvast atin (PO) 10mg 24hourly. Dose may be increased to 80mg daily if required. 
OR 
S: rosuvastatin (PO) 10mg 24hourly. Dose may be increased to 40mg daily if required  
Fenofibrate reduces incidence of retinopathy and need for laser surgery, peripheral neuropath y, and 
improvement in proteinuria, suggesting a more generalized effect on microvascular disease independent of dyslipidaemia. 
• Fibrates:
oShould be used in mixed hyperlipidemias which have not responded adequately to dietor other therapy.
oAre more effect ive in lowering triglycerides and increasing HDL, but less effective in
lowering cholestero
l.
oShould be used with caution in combination with statins.
oCan enhance the effects of warfarin and antidiabetic agents
oAre contraindicated in patients taking Orli stat.
D: fenofibrate (PO) 67 –267mg 24hourly
Hypertension  
In people with T2DM, antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) or angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria, 
promotes regression to normal albuminuria and may reduce the risk of decline in renal function. Therefore:  
•BP-lowering therapy in people with diabetes should preferentially include an angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocke r (ARB) e.g.
C: enalapril (PO) 10 – 40mg 24hourly, taken either as a single dose or two divided doses
(enalapril (PO) 5 mg –10mg 12hourly)
OR
C: losartan (PO) initial dose 50mg stat. Maintenance dose; losartan (PO) 25 –100m
g
24 hourly in single or 2 di vided doses.
•The target level for optimum BP is controversial. It is reasonable to target BP levels of
<140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes, with lower targets for younger people and those at
high risk of stroke. The target BP for people with diabetes a nd microalbuminuria or
proteinuria remains <130/80 mmHg.
•Combining an ARB and an ACEI is not recommended.
•If monotherapy does not sufficiently reduce blood pressure add one of the following :
C: amlodipine (PO) 5 –10mg 24hourl y
OR 
A: bendrofluazide (PO)  5mg 24hourly 
•ACE- inhibitors and ARBs should be stopped pre -conception. Diltiazem (PO) 60mg 24hourl y
may be a useful substitute.
19.9 Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy  
All patients should be screened for distal symmetric polyneuropathy starting at diagno sis of T2DM 
and at least annually thereafter.    
Diagnostic Criteria 
•Unsteady gait
•Burning, aching pain or tenderness in legs or feet (occurring at rest or at night, not related to
exercise)
•Prickling sensations in legs and feet (occurring at rest o r at night, distal>proximal, stocking
glove distribution)
•Numbness in legs or feet (distal>proximal, stocking glove distribution)
•History of previous foot ulceration and/or amputation.412	Investigations Test for: 
•Sensation (10g monofilament or cotton wool )
•Vibration (128Hz tuning fork)
•Postural hypotension and pulse (tibial and dorsalis)
•Inspect foot for structural abnormalities and ulceration .
Pharmacological Treatment  
It is difficult to treat. Some  of the drugs used include:  
D: pregabalin (PO) 75- 150mg (24hourly –12hourly)  for 4weeks  
Tricyclic antidepressants may help  
A: amitriptyline (PO) 25 -75mg 24hourly 
OR 
C: imipramine (PO) 100mg 24hourly 
Gastroparesis  
Due to autonomic neuropathy  
C: metoclopramide (PO) 10mg 8hourly  
OR 
D: domperidone (PO) 10mg 8 hourly 
Diabetic Foot:  
Give foot care education and advice on appropriate footwear. 
19.10 Diabetic Nephropathy  
It is one of the most important causes of chronic renal failure. Persistent microalbuminuria is both a 
marker for the development of overt neph ropathy and cardiovascular risk. Patients with 
microalbuminuria who progress to macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/24 h.) are likely to progress to end –
stage renal disease over a period of years. Patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
should be tre ated with a comprehensive strategy to reduce risks of kidney disease progression and 
cardiovascular disease.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
Patients with diabetes  and CKD should be advised to: 
Intensify m anagement of modifiable r isk fa ctors: 
•Stop smoking.
•Treat urinary infection aggressively.
•Avoid drugs toxic to the kidney.
•Consume an individualized diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fiber, legumes, plant -
based proteins, unsaturated fats, and nuts; and lower in processed meats, refi ned
carbohy drates, and sweetened beverages
•Undertake moderate -intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150
minutes per week, or to a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance
Pharmacological Treatment  
•Renin –angiotens in system (RAS) inhibition is recommended for patients with albuminuria and
hypertension
•Most patients with T2D, CKD, and eGFR => 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 would benefit fro m
treatment with both metformin and an SGLT2i.
•Patient preferences, comorbidities, eGFR , and cost should guide selection of additional drugs
to manage glycemia, when needed, with glucagon -like peptide -1 receptor agonist (GLP -1 RA)
generally preferred.
A: metformin (PO) 500mg or 850mg (12hourly – 24 hourly) ; usual maintenance dose: 1g
twice daily
SGLT- 2 Inhibitors  
S: empagliflozin (PO) 10 –25mg 24hourly 
•Advise contraception in women who are receiving ACEI or ARB therapy and discontinue
these agents in women who are considering pregnancy or who become pregnant.413	•Monitor serum creatinine and potassium annually and more frequently if there is evidence of
renal impairment.
•Hyperkalaemia associated with the use of an ACEI or ARB can often be managed by
measures to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping the
ACEI or ARB immediately
oAvoid potassium -containing salt substitute or food products containing the salt substitute.
oAvoid drugs that can impair kidney excretion of potassium: over -the-counter nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, supplements, and herbal treatme nts
oAvoid constipation by ensuring enough fluid intake and exercise.
oConsider diuretics treatment to enhance the excretion of potassium in the kidneys
especially when there is concomitant volume overload or hypertension.
oConsider oral sodium bicarbonate es pecially in patients with CKD and metabolic
acidosis.
•Metformin should not be used once the serum creatinine is > 200µmol/l.
•Treat blood pressure aggressively with target of <130/80 mmHg.
•Add diuretics if necessary (but in large doses inhibit insulin relea se).
19.11 Diabetic Retinopathy  
It is one of the major causes of blindness. Poor glycaemic control, nephropathy, hypertension and 
pregnancy, long duration of diabetes are among the risk factors. It is preventable and its progression 
retarded by improved g lycaemic control and blood pressure. Screening for early detection and laser 
therapy can prevent blindness.  
Screening for Diabetic Retinopathy  
For all people with diabetes, yearly screening is necessary for early detection of ocular complications . 
The scr eening should begin:  
•Comprehensive eye examination in woman planning pregnancy, and during the first trimester,preferably at booking of antenatal clinic (ANC). Further screening should be determined 
by
the degree of retinopathy detected at the initial app ointment.
•Five years after the diagnosis of diabetes for individuals with Type 1 diabetes diagnosed afterpuberty (around 14years).
•At puberty for individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes before puberty
•At the time of diagnosis of diabetes for individual s with type 2 diabetes
For each of the scheduled screening visits, detailed patient’s assessment should include a complete 
ophthalmic examination in the following steps:  
a.Take visual acuity (VA) without and with spectacles
b.If VA less than 6/9 take VA with p in hole
c.Dilate the pupil by using the mydriatic agents (Tropicamide)
d.Identify presence of cataract or other causes of media opacification.
e.Perform retinal evaluation by direct or indirect Ophthalmoscope or Fundus Photography
f.Identify retinal changes, docum ent and if applicable grade the diabetic retinopathy 
and
maculopathy as shown in Table XX.
g.Explain the results of screening to the patient and schedule rescreening (Table XX).

19.12 Thyroid Disorders  
Thyroid disorders are conditions that affect the thyroid gland. There are specific kinds of thyroid 
disorders that includes hypothyroidism, hyperthyr oidism, goiter, thyroid nodules and thyroid 
cancer.  
19.12.1 Hypothyroidism  
Hypothyroidism is a condition in which a person's thyroid hormone production is below normal. Common causes of the disease are chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, post -surgery and pos t 
radioactive iodine.   
Diagnostic criteria  
The symptoms depend on the deficiency of thyroid hormone, but can include: 
•Increased cholesterol levels
,
•Depression
•Fatigue
•Hair loss•Memory loss
•Dry, rough skin
•Constipation
•Hoarse voice
Investigati on 
A blood test is used to confirm hypothyroidism 
Indications for Treatment 
•TSH level persistently >10mU/L; treat all patients due to, increased likelihood of progressi on
to overt disease and a higher risk of congestive heart failure, cardiovascular dis ease and
mortality.
•TSH levels (4.5 –10mU/L); consider, treatment in patients younger than 65 with increas ed
cardiovascular risk (e.g., previous cardiovascular disease, hypertension, documented
diastolic dysfunction, atherosclerotic risk factors (dyslipida emia, diabetes mellitus, smoker),
goitre, positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, evidence of autoimmune thyroiditis by
ultrasound, pregnancy, or infertility), particularly when TSH level is persistently >7mU/L.
•Levothyroxine therapy could be consider ed also for symptomatic middle -aged patients for a
short period of time. If a clear beneficial effect is observed, levothyroxine therapy could bemaintained.
•Persistently mildly increased TSH levels (>4.5– 10mU/L) with positive Thyroid Antibody 
and
thyroid  sonographic findings typical of autoimmune thyroiditis.
Pharmacological Treatment 
Initial dose:  
Clinical hypothyroidism – 
D: levothyroxine 1.6 –1.8µg/kg ideal body weight 
Subclinical hypothyroidism – 
D: levothyroxine 1.1 –1.2µg/kg is recommended  
•Take at least after 2hours fast, 30minutes before food intake. Alternatively, at bedtime (3 or
more hours after the evening meal).
•When initiating therapy in young healthy adults with overt hypothyroidism, consider beginningtreatment with full replacemen t doses
•Routine use of combined therapy with levothyroxine and triiodothyronine for hypothyroid
patients is not recomm
ended415	•Assess TSH and adjust dosage when there are large changes in body weight, with aging, and
with pregnancy.
•There is no convincing evidence to support routine use of thyroid extracts, L -T3 monotherapy,
compounded thyroid hormones, iodine containing preparations, dietary supplementation, and
over the counter preparations in the management of hypothyroidism.
Monitoring 
•TSH monitoring  6–8weeks after any levothyroxine dose change, and yearly life –long
monitoring once euthyroidism is achieved (target TSH 0.2 –4.0um/l). FT4 can be measured i n
early stages of treatment.
•In patients with central hypothyroidism, assessments of serum free T4 should guide therap y
and targeted to exceed the mid normal range value for the assay being used.
•Wait for TSH equilibration –TSH equilibration requires eight to 12 weeks after any thyroxi ne
dosage change. Once a stable dose is achieved –yearly TSH is suffic ient.
In Pregnancy  
When the elevation of the TSH level is confirmed, free T4 should be measured in order to classify 
the hypothyroidism as clinical or overt (OH) and subclinical (SH).  
•TSH > 2.5 –10.0mU/L with normal free T4: SH.
•TSH > 2.5 –10.0mU/L wit h low levels of free T4: OH.
•TSH =10.0mU/L, despite the level of free T4: OH
Women in reproductive period should be euthyroid before conceiving, as the hypothyroidism is 
associated with neural development. Dose may be doubled during pregnancy and return ed to 
normal dose after delivery  
19.12.2 Hyperthyroidism  
Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which an overactive thyroid gland is producing an excessive amount of thyroid hormones that circulate in the blood. Graves' disease, multinodular goiter (TMNG), in flammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis) and excessive iodine intake are the most 
common cause of hyperthyroidism.  
Diagnostic criteria  
Hyperthyroidism can be suspected in patients with 
• Tremors
• Excessive sweating
• Smooth velvety skin
• Fine hair• A rapid heart rate
• An enlarged thyroid gland
• Frequent bowel  movements
Investigations 
• Baseline complete blood count, including white count with differential, and a liver profile
(bilirubin and transaminases
)
• Differential white blood cell count should be obtained during febrile illness and at the onset
of pharyngitis in all patients taking antithyroid medication. Routine monitoring of white bl ood
counts is not recommended
• Test for THS and T4
• When thyrotoxicosis is confirmed, if cause is not known requ est thyroid uptake sc an
Note  
Management of hyperthyroidism depends on the cause 
19.12.3 Toxic Multinodular Goitre or Thyroid Antibody Positive  
Patients with overtly Toxic multinodular goitre or Thyroid antibody are treated with either: 
Non-pharmacolo gical Treatment  
S: Radio iodine (131 -I) therapy 
OR  
S: Thyroidectomy  
Note  
Long term, low -dose carbimazole should not be used for either conditions except in some elderly  416	Surgery 
•Patients with overt hyperthyroidism should be rendered euthyroid prior t o the procedure wit h
carbimazole pre- treatment (15 –40mg daily, divided into 2 –3doses a day for 4 –8 weeks then a
maintenance dose of 5 –15mg, taken once daily) with or without beta –adrenergic block ade
(e.g. propranolol 1 —40mg 6hourly). Preoperative iodine sh ould not be used in this setting.
•Following thyroidectomy for Toxic multinodular goitre, it is suggested that serum calcium or
intact parathyroid hormone levels be measured, and that calcitriol and oral calcium
supplementation (maximum 1,200mg of calcium per day in two divided doses) be
administered based on these results.
•Following surgery for Toxic multinodular goitre, thyroid hormone replacement should be
started at a dose appropriate for the patient’s weight (0.8 µg/lb or 1.7 µg/kg) and age, with
elderl y patients needing somewhat less. TSH should be measured every 1 –2months until
stable, and then annually.
Radioiodine 
•Radioactive iodine therapy should be used for retreatment of persistent or recurrent
hyperthyroidism following inadequate surgery for T oxic multinodular goitre or Thyroi d
antibody.
19.12.4 Grave’s Hyperthyroidism  
Patients with overt Graves’ hyperthyroidism should be treated with: 
Medicine Initial therapy  for 4 –6 
weeks  Maintenance therapy   
(gradual reduction over 3 –6 months from init ial dose) 
C: carbimazole 10–60mg/day in 2- 3 
divided dose  5–10mg/day  
Continue for approximately 12 –18months, then taper or 
discontinue if TSH is normal.  
Beta Blockers are used for excessive sympathetic symptoms. 
A: propranolol (PO) 40 to 120mg (24h ourly or 12hourly) 
OR  
B: atenolol (PO) 50 –100mg 12hourly 
Factors which favour use of antithyroid medicines 
•High likelihood of remission (patients, especially females, with mild disease, small goitres,
and negative or low -titre TSH -receptor antibody )
•Elderly or others with comorbidities increasing surgical risk or with limited life expectancy orunable to follow radiation safety regulations
•Previously operated or irradiated necks
•Moderate to severe active Graves’ ophthalmopathy
Radioactive Iodine  
Potassium iodide ( B) should be given in the immediate preoperative period as 5 –7drops (0.25 –
0.35 mL) Lugol’s solution (8 mg iodide/drop) or 1 –2 drops (0.05 –0.1 mL) saturated solution of 
potassium iodide (50 mg iodide/drop) three times daily mixed in water or juice for 10 days before 
surgery 
Factors which favour use of radioiodine 
• Individuals with comorbidities 
increasing surgical risk 
•Patients with previously operated orexternally irradiated necks
•Lack of access to a high -volum
e
thyroid surgeon•Contr aindications to antithyroid 
medicines use
•Females who are not pregnant and
are not planning a pregnancy in t he
future (4 –6months) followi ng
radioiodine therapy
Surgery  
Consider the following factors 
•Symptomatic compression or large goitres
•Low uptake of radioactive iodi ne
•Thyroid malignancy is documented or suspected or large non -functioning nodule
•Coexisting hyperparathyroidism requiring surgery417	•Females planning a pregnancy in <4 –6months
•Patients with moderate to severe active Graves’ ophthalmop athy
•If a patient with Grave’s disease becomes hyperthyroid after completing a course o f
carbimazole, consideration should be given to treatment with radioactive iodine or
thyroidectomy. Low -dose carbimazole treatment for longer than 12 –18months may be
considered in patients not in remission who prefer this approach but evidence is that
remission rate in adults is not improved by a course of medicines longer than 18 months
•Whenever possible, patients with Grave’s disease undergoing thyroidectomy should berendered euthyroid with carbimazole.
19.12.5 Thyroid Storm (Crisis)  
Thyroid storm is one of the most life -threatening endocrine emergencies, resulting from 
exacerbation of manifestations of thyrotoxicosis.  
Triggers of thyroid storm include : 
•Antithyroi d withdraw
•Acute infections
•Thyroidal or nonthyroidal surgeries
•Iodinated contrast dyes
•External beam radiation therapy.
•It should be considered in very sick patients if they present with recent history o f
thyrotoxicosis and a recent history of precipi tating factor .
Patients with thyroid storm (tachycardia, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, hypotension, 
hyperpyrexia, agitation, delirium, psychosis, stupor and coma, as well as nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, and hepatic failure) should receive a mult imodal treatment including:  
• Beta-adrenergic block ade
• Antithyroid medicine therapy
• Inorganic iodide
• Corticosteroid therapy
• Aggressive cooling with
acetaminophen and cooling blankets• Volume resuscitation
• Respiratory support
• Monitoring in an intensi ve care unit.
Thyroid storm is not a matter of thyroid levels increased beyond those of uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis, but the systemic decompensation that occurs.

Cushing syndrome is a clinical condition resulting from prolonged exposure to excessive 
glucoccorticoids from either endogenous or exogenous sources. The most common cause of 
Cushing’s syndrome is from the administration of exogenous sources.  
Classification Cushing syndrome can be divided into two categories based on pathophysiology, ACTH dependent or ACTH – Independent  
•ACTH -dependent States
o Pituitary Adenoma (Cushing’s Disease) 90 -95%
o Ectopic ACTH Syndrome
•ACTH -independent States
o Adrenal adenoma
o Adrenal carcinoma
•Exogenous Sources
o Glucocorticoid intake
•Psychiatric Conditions (Pseudo -Cushing Disorders)
o Depression
o Alcoholism
•High Cortisol Secretion Rate without Convincing Clinical Features of Cu shing Syndrome
•Pregnancy
Symptoms and signs of Cushing’s syndrome  
•The symptoms and signs of Cushing's syndrome result directly from chronic exposure t
o
excess glucocorticoi d
•Establishing the diagnosis is often difficult because none of the symptoms or si gns ar e
pathognomonic of the syndrome.
•An important clinical clue to the presence of glucocorticoid excess is the simultaneousdevelopment and increasing severity of several of these symptoms
•Common  presenting symptoms include
oCentral obesity
oFacial pleth ora
oWeakness of the proximal muscles
oEasily bruises and striae
oHirsutism
oGlucose intolerance
Diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome  
At least two first -line tests should be abnormal to establish the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome 
•The low- dose dexamethasone suppression test
s
•24hrs urinary cortisol,
•Late night salivary cortisol
•Differential  Diagnostic Testing to established, the cause of Cushing’s syndrome
oMorning serum ACTH
oHigh dose dexamethasone suppression test
Imaging diagnosis  
•Pituitary CT - sensit ivity of about 50% for identifying microadenomas
•MRI pituitary   sensitivity up to 100 %
•Adrenal  ultrasonography/CT for suspected Adrenal sourc e
Treatment of Cushing’s syndrome  
Without therapy, Cushing’s syndrome is often fatal. 
•Typically, due to CV, HTN or infectious complications.
•With therapy Symptoms improve over 2 -12 months.
Definitive Therapy  
Surgery by source when possible  
•Adrenal source - Adrenalectomy
•Pituitary source - Transphenoidal resection
•Ectopic  source - Tumor Resection435	Medical th erapy  
S: metyrapone (PO) 30mg/kg, maximum dose 3,000mg, administered at midnight usually 
with a snack  
19.14 Prolactinoma 
Are prolactin – secreting pituitary tumors  
Classification 
May present as Microprolactinomas (<10mm) or Macroprolactinomas (>10mm)  
Clinical Presentation  
Symptoms are due to hyperprolactinemia which include galactorhea, oligo/amenorrhea, infertility, reduced libido, impotence and gynacomastia in male, headache and visual abnormality in large 
adenomas.  
Diagnosis  
Serum prolactin levels  
<100ng/ml possible prolactinoma  
100-200ng/ml likely prolactinoma
>200 ng/ml –diagnostic of prolactinoma
Treatment  
Proactinomas are unique among pituitary tumors in that first line treatment is medical not surgical.  
The mainstays of management for prolactinom as are the dopamine agonist which are:  
C: bromocriptine (PO) 2.5 -20mg (24hourly or 12hourly)  
OR 
S: cabergoline (PO) 0.25 -1mg (twice a week)  
19.15 Diabetic Insipidus (DI)  
DI is a disorder of water balance caused by non -osmotic renal loss of water leading t o excretion of 
large volume of dilute urine  
Classification 
Central DI : Is caused by either complete or partial deficiency of antidiurectic hormone (ADH) 
secretion from the posterior pituitary gland  
Nephrogenic DI : Is caused by end organ unresponsiveness of the kidney to ADH  
Dipsogenic DI : Is caused by excessive and inappropriate fluid intake due to a defective in thirsty 
mechanism  
Clinical Presentations  
Polyuria especially nocturnal  
Diagnostic criteria  
•Polyuria and urine osmolality of <300 for a given p lasma osmolality
•Volume depletion and orthostatic hypotension may be found
•Plasma  Sodium may be normal or elevated
Pharmacological Treatment  
In case of water deficit - water replacement. Treating of the underlying defect 
Central DI:  
S: desmopressin (IV)  2-4 µg/day divided 12hourly 
OR 
S: desmopressin (PO) Initial dose 0.05mg 12hourly; effective range: 0.1 -1.2mg divided 8-

Pheochromocytoma are neuroendocrine tumors arising from catecholamine producing chromaffin 
cells of the adrenal medullar but a bout 15– 20% are extra -adrenal in origin  
Clinical presentation  
•The classic symptoms of pheochromocytoma are due to episodic release of excess
catecholamines into circulation (Norepinephrine and Epine phrine)
•Typical symptoms
oheadaches
opalpitations
oanxiety and diaphoresis
ohypertension which can be paroxysmal ( ∼48%) or persistent ( ∼29%).

Tumor Localization  
•Anatomic localization of a catecholamine -secreting tumor should be performed only after
biochemical diagnosis has been confirmed
•Approximately 85% of catecholamine- secreting tumors are found in the adrenal glands, and
95% are found in the abdomen and pelvis
•Either CT or MRI are effective for localization of catecholamine -secreting tumors -sensitivit y
89 vs 98% resp.
Management of Pheochromocytoma 
•After definitive diagnosis, the mainstay of definitive therapy is complete surgical resection of
the tumor
•Prior to planned surgical intervention, the effects of excess catecholamines must be
ameliorated in or der to avoid perioperative complications and improve outcome, by using α -
adrenergic antagonists
None selective α-antagonist  
S: phenoxybenzamine (PO) 10mg 12hourly initially; increase to 20 -40 mg 8- 12hourly

Combined α + β blockade 
19.17 Disorder of Sexual Development (DSD)  
DSD formerly known as intersex conditions are classified on the basis of genetics and the state of 
gonads. They may be caused by virilization 64XX or under virilization 46XY.  As well as mosaism 
(streak Ovary, Ovotestis, dysgentic testis). The most common DSD is Congenital Adrenal 
Hyperplasia (CAH).  
Diagnostic criteria  
•Infant born with ambiguous or abnormal genitalia
•Infant with undescended testis, unilateral or bilateral
•Infant with hypospadias437	Investigations  
•Serum electrolytes
•Chromosomal analysis
•Karyotyping in a male looking male with undescended testis and/or hypospadias whether the
genitalia appears normal or not

• The condition
• Naming of a child and
• Gender assignment
Pharmacological Treatment  
Depends on type of the DSD it is either CAH or other forms of DSD (Non CAH DSD)  
CAH DSD Salt losing in crisis - 
•Bolus  normal saline (0.9% NaCl) and maintenance,
•Hypoglycemic 2 -4 ml of 10% dextros
e
Long- term treatment 
S: fludrocortisone (PO) 0.05 -0.3mg 24hourly

19.8 Obesi ty in Adults  
Diagnosis  
•Body mass index (BMI) = weight divided by height squared (weight in kg, height in meters)
•Ideal BMI is from 18.5- 24.9: less than 18.5 is underweight, 25 -29.9 is overweight and 30+ is
obese.
•Overweight/obesity increases risk of CVD, t ype 2 diabetes, pulmonary embolism, gallbladder
disease, colorectal cancer, osteoarthritis, chronic back pain and all -cause mortality, especiall y
for those with high blood pressure,hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia.
•Individuals living with obesity are subj ect to considerable stigma, which they may internaliz e
and experience as shame, depression and anxiety.
•As part of prevention of non- communicable diseases, for all adults attending health facilities,
height, weight and waist circumference should be measured at least yearly and appropriat e
action taken:
oEveryone should be educated on the risks of overweight/obesity and the need to avoidweight gain by adjusting food intake and engaging in regular physical activity
oWeight loss treatment is indicated for the o bese or those overweight with increas
ed
cardiovascular risk (e.g. diabetes, prediabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, elevated
waist circumference) or other obesity -related comorbidities.
oEvaluate diet, previous and current physical activity, and disorders of sleep, eating and
mood
oAssess the patient's medication regimen for drugs that may contribute to weight gain and
consider adjustment s
oDetermine diabetes and CVD risk
▪ High Blood Pressure
▪ Hyperlipidemia
▪ Hyperglycemia
▪ Elevated liver enzymes (Non -alcoholic liver disease)
Non-pharmacological Management  
•Even modest, sustained weight  loss of 3%–5% produce clinically  meaningful  reductions
in triglycerides, blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes .438	•Greater  amounts  of weight  loss will reduce  blood pressure,  improve  LDL- Cholesterol
and HDL-Choleste rol, and reduce the need for medications to control BP, blood glucose,
and lipids as well as further reduce triglycerides and blood glucose.
•Weight loss requires creating an energy deficit through caloric restriction, physical activity, or
both
oAim for a l oss of 5% -10% of baseline weight within 6 months (0· 5 kg per week for 6
months: total about 8kg)
oPrescribe a diet to achieve energy deficit of ≥500 kcal/d: may be achieved with dietary
intake of 1200 -1500 kcal/d for women and 1500 -1800 kcal/d for men (25 -30kcal/kg/day)
oThe choice of diet should address a patient’s preference and ease of adherence and be
directed towards long -term lifestyle changes that include eating patterns that are
practical, achievable, and sustainable
oUse of very- low-calorie diets (<80 0 kcal/d) should be advised only under medical
supervision
oProteins
▪ Aim for approximately 20% of total energy from good quality proteins, lean meatsand whole pulses
▪ Proteins  induce a feeling of satiety and any excess is deaminated.
oFats
▪ Aim for 20% or les s of total energy from fats
▪ Avoid saturated fats to reduce the risk of heart problems
▪ Restrict or avoid fried foods
▪ Choose low fat milk.
oCarbohydrates
▪ Aim for 60% of energy from complex carbohydrates
▪ Whole grains, roots & tubers, e.g. sweet potatoes, yams
▪ Limit sugars and honey.
▪ Vegetables e.g. broccoli, mushroom, zucchini, cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, celery
▪ Fruits such as pineapple, apples, cherimoya, peach, grapefruit, watermelon
oAvoid
▪ Alcohol as it provides calories without nutrients, and excessive use  is harmful in
many ways
▪ Omit fad diets and other unhealthy practices
•Tailored physical activity program
oInitially 30 min of moderate intensity 3 -5 times per week
oeventually ≥60 min on most days; add muscle strengthening on at least two days/week
oWeight regain following weight loss is reduced by physical activity equiva lent to 60 min
of brisk walking daily and lifestyle activity that increases energy expenditure th roughout
the day without concern for the intensity or duration can be as effective for weight control
as jogging, swimming, or cycling.
•Offer behavioural support
oidentify cues that prompt overeating or inactivity, and restruc ture thoughts and
behaviours to prompt healthy responses
oAdvise patient to
▪set goals that specify what, when, where, how, and for how long they will engage in
a selected activity
▪keep detailed records of food intake, physical activity, and bodyweight
▪eat breakfast regularly and maintain  a consistent eating pattern across weekdays
and weekends
▪engage family members for ongoing support
▪participate for ≥6 months in a lifestyle program that assists participants in adheri
ng
to a lower -calorie diet and in increasing physical activity
oFor those  who have lost weight, prescribe face- to-face or telephone- delivered weight
loss maintenance programs that provide regular contact (monthly or more frequently)
and helps participants to engage in high levels of physical activity  (ie, 200– 300
min/wk),  monit or body  weight  regularly  (ie, weekly  or more frequently), and consume
a reduced- calorie diet (needed to maintain lower body weight).
•Facilitate  referral to a specialist team (metabolic obesity clinic and/or metabolic surgery) if
patient:439	ois unable to achie ve >= 5% weight loss at 3 months on a lifestyle intervention consisti ng
of reduced energy/low -energy diet, increased physical activity, and/or pharmacotherapy
ohas a BMI ≥40 kg/m2 or BMI ≥35 kg/m2 with obesity -related comorbid conditions and
has not responded to behavioral treatment with or without pharmacotherapy to consider
bariatric surgery
oMonitor the patient's requirements for medication as weight loss progresses, particularly
for antihypertensive and diabetes medications that can cause hypotension and
hypoglycemia.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Drug therapy may be considered for those with a  BMI ≥30kg/m2, BMI ≥27kg/m2 with obesity -related 
comorbid conditions, or if patient has not lost 0 ·5kg per week by 3 –6months after lifestyle changes  
S: orlistat (PO) 120mg 8hourly with each main meal containing fat (during or up    to one hour after the m eal). It inhibits pancreatic and gastric lipase, reducing fat absorption by 
approximately 30%  
•Anti-obesity pharmacotherapy should be continued beyond 12weeks only if at least 5% of
initial body weight has been lost since starting medication and should be prescribed as 
an
adjunct to lifestyle interventions.
Innovative strategies for delivery and management of obesity care  
Primary care should be enhanced with:  
•patient registries and methods for systematic tracking to assess clinical interventions
(electroni c health records)
•care teams to manage patients with chronic illnesses
•health information systems that support the use of evidence -based practices at the point -of-
care to provide longitudinal care for chronic illnesses.
•Electronic support
otext messaging to  provide outreach, support for behaviour change to patients and
educational messages
oBlood pressure, blood glucose and wi -fi scales, which automatically transmit results from
machine to a server
osmartphones and tablets with weight loss applications to simp lify monitoring of food
intake, physical activity, and weight
ointerventions by telephone, study -specific website, and email
oRemote support offers flexibility to patients and practitioners and can be scaled up or
down according to patients’ needs.
Hospital s and health professionals as role models  
•An overweight/obese health worker is less likely to counsel patients with obesity
•Provide healthy food choices for patients, employers, visitors, and communities, with pricing
incentives
•Label drinks sold in hospit al cafeterias as red, yellow, or green to shift consumption towards
healthier beverages
•Prohibit fast food outlets in hospital premises
19.19 Physical Activity  
•Physical fitness is the ability to perform physical activities without undue fatigue and is
achieved through proper nutrition, moderate to vigorous physical activity, and sufficient rest.
•Physical activity
oImproves insulin resistance, reduces HbA1c by 0.7% in Type II diabetes and protects
against the development of Type II diabetes
oImproves lipid pr ofile, lowers blood pressure and helps maintain appropriate body
weight.
•Physical activities
oInclude:
▪Those associated with the performance of a job e.g. walking, hauling, lifting,pushing, carpentry, farming, shoveling, packing boxes, etc.
▪Those done duri ng free time e.g. structured exercise as well as walking, hiking,
gardening, sport, dance, etc.440	oRequire contraction of skeletal muscle and increased energy expenditure above the
resting level.
•The types of physical activity for optimal fitness include aero bic, muscle- strengthening,
stretching and coordination.
Aerobic Activities  
•These improve the body composition (fat, muscle and bone) and cardiorespiratory fitness
•Examples:
obrisk walking, climbing stairs, cycling, swimming, dancing, jogging, running, wash ing
windows or car, sweeping floors or carpet, vacuuming, mopping, shoveling, digging
ditches, carrying heavy loads such as bricks
oSports: badminton, golf, tennis, volleyball, swimming, basketball, football, jumping jacks,
jumping rope.
•For optimal effect,  the activity has to be:
oModerate intensity (a person doing moderate -intensity aerobic activity can talk, but no t
sing, during the activity) or vigorous (cannot say more than a few words without pausingfor a breath).
oFor at least 30 minutes per day at lea st five days per week.
Muscle -strengthening Activities  
•These enable the major muscle groups of the body (the legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen,
shoulders, and arms) to do more work than they are accustomed and thus increase muscle
mass, strength and endura nce.
•Examples: pull -down, pull -ups, push -ups, dips, abdominal crunch/curl -up, calf raises,
jumping, carrying heavy loads, and heavy gardening (digging or hoeing).
•For optimal effect:
oEach activity should consist of at least 8 repetitions of the movement (e .g. 8 push -ups)
oEach muscle group should be active on at least two days per week.
Stretching Activities 
•Improve flexibility such as range of motion, e.g. ability to bend down to tie your shoe.
•Examples: neck flexions, arm rotations, trunk rotations, and s tretching of muscles.
Coordination Activities  
•Improve neuromuscular fitness such as balance, agility and proprioception necessary for
example to prevent falls in the elderly
•Examples: Standing on the toes of one leg.
Improving Exercise Adoption and Maint enance 
As part of risk factor assessment in disease prevention, the physical activity level of all patients 
attending health facilities should be assessed, followed by brief advice, if required, about 
recommended levels.  441	CHAPTER TWENTY 
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONDITIONS 
20.1 Prevention of Atherosclerotic Ischaemic Heart Disease and Stroke  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention is a coordinated set of actions, at the population level or 
targeted at an individual at risk of developing cardiovascular diseas e, that are aimed at eliminating or 
minimizing the impact of CVDs and their related disabilities.  
Diagnostic/screening Criteria  
Major risk factors for ischaemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease are:  
• Diabetes mellitus
• Hypertension
• Central obes ity: waist circumference ≥  94cm (men) and ≥  80cm (women)
• Dyslipidaemia (fasting levels): Total cholesterol > 5 mmol/L, or LDL> 3mmol/L, or HDL< 1
mmol/L in men and < 1.2mmol/L in women
• Smoking
• Age: Men >50 years, Women >60 years
• Family history of early on set cardiovascular disease; Male relatives <55 years and Female
relatives <65 year
Estimation of total cardiovascular risk is important for prevention of CVD in an individual, should be 
adapted to his or her total CV risk: the higher the risk, the more in tense the management should be 
(See Table 20.1).  
Table 20.1: Cardiovascular Disease Risk Classification and WHO Risk estimation 
Very High 
Risk Subjects with any of the following:  
•Documented CVD, clinical or unequivocal on imaging: previous AMI, ACS, co ronary
revascularization and other arterial revascularization procedures, stroke and TIA, aortic
aneurysm and PAD. Unequivocally documented CVD on imaging includes plaque on coronar y
angiography or carotid ultrasound. It does NOT  include some increase in c ontinuous imagi ng
parameters such as intima –media thickness of the carotid artery.
•DM with target organ damage such as proteinuria or with a major risk factor such as smoking
or marked hypercholesterolaemia or marked hypertension.
•Severe CKD (GFR <30mL /min/1.73m ²).
•A calculated CVD Risk Score ≥10%.
High Risk Subjects with:  
•Markedly elevated single risk factors, in cholesterol >8mmol/L (>310mg/dL) (e.g. in familial
hypercholesterolaemia) or BP ≥180/110mmHg.
•Most other people with DM (except for y oung people with type 1 DM and without major risk
factors that may be at low or moderate risk).
•Moderate CKD (GFR 30 –59mL/min/1.73m ²).
•A calculated CVD Risk Score ≥5% and <10%.
Moderate 
Risk CVD Risk Score is ≥1% and <5% at 10years. Many middle –aged 
subjects belong to this category  
Low Risk CVD Risk Score <1%  
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
General measures:  
• Lifestyle modification (refer to table 20.2)
Table 20.2: The Summarized Preventive Measures to be Individualized on Targeted Goals  
Risk fa ctor goals and target levels for important cardiovascular disease risk factor reduction 
1 Smoking  No exposure to tobacco in any form. 
2 Diet Reduce dietary sodium intake no more than 1000mmol/L (2.4gm sodium or 6gm 
sodium chloride per day)  
Low in satura ted fat with a focus on wholegrain products, vegetables, fruit, and 
fish. 
Reduce alcohol intake to ≤ 2 units/day for men and ≤1 unit for women, not more 
than 5 out of 7days per week (1 unit is equivalent to 25mL of spirits, 125mL of 
wine, 340mL of beer or sorghum beer, or 60mL of sherry).  
3 Physical activity At least 150minutes a week of moderate aerobic exercise (30minutes for 442	5days/week) or 75minutes a week of vigorous aerobic exercise (15minutes for 
5days/week) or a combination thereof  
4 Body weight  Body weight BMI 18.5 –24.9kg/m ² 
Waist circumference <94 cm (men) or <80 cm (women)  
5 Blood Pressure  <140/90mmHg  
6 Lipids  
LDL– C is the  
primary target  Very high risk: <1.8 mmol/L (<70mg/dL), or a reduction of at least 50% if the 
baseline is between 1.8 and 3.5mmol/L (70 and 135mg/dL)  
High risk: <2.6mmol/L (<100mg/dL), o r a reduction of at least 50% if the baseline 
is between 2.6 and 5.1mmol/L (100 and 200mg/dL)  
Low to moderate risk: <3.0mmol/L (<115mg/dL)  
HDL–C No target but >1.0mmol/L (>40mg/dL) in men an d >1.2mmol/L (>45mg/dL) in 
women indicate lower risk 
Triglycerides  No target but <1.7mmol/L (<150mg/dL) indicates lower risk and higher levels 
indicate a need to look for other risk factors.  
7 Diabetes HbA1c <7%. (<5.3mmol/l)  
Recommended to repeat CV risk assessment every 5years, and more often for individuals with risks 
close to thresholds mandating treatment.  
Pharmacological Treatment: Forspecific pharmacological treatment for hypertension, diabetes, 
dyslipidemia refer specific sections, respective ly. 
20.2 Management of Dyslipidemias  
Lowering blood cholesterol levels using statins is recommended to reduce the impact of 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  
Clinical indication for lipid lowering medicine therapy  
• Established atherosclerotic disease
• Ischaemic heart disease
• Peripheral vascular disease
• Atherothrombotic stroke
Note  
Lipid lowering medicines should be administered in this setting even if the level of cholesterol is 
normal  
• Type 2 diabetics >40 years of age, or diabetes for >10 years,
• Existing cardiovascular disease,
• Chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 60mL/min).
• CV risks of more than >20% in 10years Such high -risk patients will benefit from lipid lowering
(statin) therapy irrespective of their baseline LDL levels.
Pharmacological Treatm ent 
B: atorvastatin (PO) 20mg to 80mg 24hourly  
OR 
S: rosuvastatin (PO) 10mg -40mg 24hourly 
AND 
D: fenofibrate (PO) 120mg /160mg /200mg 24hourly  
Note  
• Criteria for initiating lipid lowering therapy are the same as for HIV uninfected patients. Fasting
lipid levels should be done 3months after starting lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir .
• Patients at high risk (>20% risk of developing a CVS event in 10years) should switch toatazanavir/ritonavir and repeat the fasting lipid profile in 3 months.
• Concomitant use of Ezetimibe andAtorvastatin can  lead to liver damage and rhabdomyolysis
.
• Fenofibrate indicated Hypertriglyceridemia, in which statin alone is not enough to treat & lowerthe hypertriglyceridemia.443	20.3   Chronic Stable Coronary Artery Dis ease (CSCAD) / ISCHAEMIC Heart 
Disease (IHD)  
Clinical history characterized by chest pain due to myocardial ischaemia usually inducible by 
exercise, emotion, or other stress and reproducible, relieved by rest but may occur spontaneously 
and stable in natur e, occurs in high -risk patient.   
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
General Measures  
• Lifestyle modification (refer to table 20.2).
• Annual control of lipids, glucose metabolism and creatinine are recommended in all patients withknown IHD.
• A resting ECG is r ecommended in all patients at presentation and during or immediately after 
an
episode of chest pain suspected to indicate clinical instability of CAD, Consider immediat e
referral.
• A resting transthoracic echocardiogram is recommended in some patients for :
a) exclusion of alternative causes of anginab) regional wall motion abnormalities suggestive of CAD
c) measurement of LVEF for risk stratification purpose
d) evaluation of diastolic function.
Consider referral if no echocardiogram available or unavai lability of skilled personnel to perform
transthoracic.
• Stress ECG
• Stress Echocardiography; a) Physical (Exercise) Stress Echo; b) Dobutamine (Pharmacological)
Stress Echo performed to Orthopaedic related disorders pt who cannot walk on the Treadmill
machi ne).
Pharmacological Treatment  
A: acetylsalicylic acid soluble (PO) 75 –150mg 24hourly 
AND 
C: isosorbide dinitrate (PO) 20mg -40mg 12hourly 
If nitrates cannot be tolerated, consider stepwise approach below.  
S: ivabradine (PO) 2.5mg /5mg 24hourly 
Step 1: add ß -blocker if not contraindicated:  
B: atenolol (PO) 12.5/25mg 24hourly 
OR 
S: metoprolol tartrate (IV) 5mg 2min for max 3doses, then (PO) 50 -100mg 12hourly 
OR 
C: metoprolol succinate (SR) (PO) 25 –200mg 24hourly 
OR 
S: bisoprolol (PO) 2.5mg /10mg 24hour ly

Step 2:  add long- acting calcium channel blocker.  
S: verapamil (PO) 60mg -120mg 8hourly 24hourly 
OR  
D: diltiazem (PO) 60mg 6 to 8hourlydaily; if suspec ts Prinzmetal Angina.  
Key Points 
• All patients with chronic stable angina are high -risk for cardiovascular events, lipid lowering
medicines should be initiated (See Section 20.2).
• Consider immediate referral to high level of care where there are adequate resources for the
case management.
Indications for Referral 
• Angina or chest pain suspected to indicate clinical instability of CAD
• When diagnosis is in doubt/ failed medical therapy; no echocardiogram available or
unavailability of skilled personnel to  perform transthoracic echocardiogram.444	Before referral when high likelihood of clinical instability of stable CAD consider giving: 
A: acetylsalicylic acid (PO) 300mg stat.  
AND 
B: atorvastatin (PO) 80mgstat 
AND  
D: clopidogrel (PO) 300mg  stat 
20.4    Ac ute Coronary Syndrome 
20.4.1 Unstable Angina (UA)  
Unstable angina is a medical emergency  and if untreated can progress to Non -ST Elevation 
Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)  
Diagnostic Criteria  
Presents as chest pain or discomfort like stable angina but with  the following additional 
characteristics:  
• Angina at rest or minimal effort, occurring for the first time, particularly at rest and prolonged
>10minutes, not relieved by sublingual nitrates.
• The pattern of angina accelerates and gets worse.
• The chest pain  may be associated with ST segment depression or T wave inversion or
normal ECG without rise in cardiac enzymes (biomarkers ie. Total Createnine, Creatine -
MB and Troponin).
20.4.2 Non- ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)  
Non-ST Elevation Myocardia l Infarction is a medical emergency  characterized with chest pain that is 
increasing in frequency and/or severity or occurring at rest, associated with elevated cardiac enzymes and ST segment depression or T wave inversion or normal ECG.  
Diagnostic Criteria  
Presents with typical chest pain with the following additional characteristics. 
• Electrocardiogram (ECG) may show ST segment depression or transient ST segment
elevation, or normal ECG does not exclude the diagnosis (serial ECG is important).
• Raised Cardiac Biomakers – Total Creatine Kinase (Total -CK), Creatine Kinase - MB (CK -
MB) and standard/high sensitive Troponin I or T.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Both UA and NSTEMI are medical emergencies with the same pathophysiological progressive 
instability of CAD, which share similar management approach.  
Supportive Therapy 
• Admit patient into high dependent ward/ICU/CCU for haemodynamic monitoring, bed rest
in Fowler’s position and reassurance.
• Oxygen via nasal blog cannula or face mask if saturation < 9 2%.

Definitive management of STEMI – Reperfusion therapy (Myocardial reperfusion)  
Myocardial reper fusion with rapid recanalization of infarct related artery is the key to success in the 
management of ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). Timely reperfusion is crucial for 
minimization of infarct size and thereby for preservation of left ventricula r function and reduction in 
mortality in STEMI patients. The two main reperfusion strategies for STEMI patients are;  
• Thrombolytic/Fibrinolytic therapy (preferably chest pain duration less 12 hrs)
• Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) (preferab ly less than 90 mins of Door to
Needle Time)
Thrombolytic agents 
S: streptokinase (IV) 1.5 million units diluted in 100 mL sodium chloride 0.9%, infused over 
30–60minutes  
OR 
S: alteplase (TPA) (IV) 15mg as bolus, 0.75mg/kg over 30min, then 0.5mg/kg over 60min
Absolute contraindication for Thrombolytics 
• Previous allergy to streptokinase or used within the last year for streptokinase only.
• Stroke CVA within the last 3 months
• History of recent major trauma
• Bleeding within the last month
• Aneurysms
• Brain or  spinal surgery or head injury within the preceding month
• Active bleeding or known bleeding disorder.
Relative contraindication for Thrombolytics  
• Refractory hypertension
• TIA in the preceding 6 months,
• Subclavian central venous catheter
• Warfarin therapy• Pregnancy
• Traumatic resuscitation
• Recent retinal laser treatment
Referral is urgent for all suspected or diagnosed cases to high level care equipped with cardiac catheterization laboratory for Coronary angiogram (CAG) followed by Percutenous Coronary 
Intervention (PCI).  
20.5 Hypertensi on 
Hypertension is elevation of Blood Pressure SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and DBP ≥90 mmHg measured 
atleast three separate occasions. Hypertension is a major independent risk factor for the 
development of CAD, stroke, and renal failure. 
Diagnostic Criteria  
Blood Pressu re should be measured on three separate occasions, a minimum of 2 days apart and/or 
taken over period of two months. Minimum of 3 blood pressure readings must be taken at the first 
visit to confirm hypertension.  
Ambulatory Blood Pressure monitoring should be done to exclude Masked or white coat hypertension 
and monitoring of Blood Presure response to anti- hypetensives.  449	Table 20.3: Classification of Hypertension  
Class of 
hypertension SBP 
mmHG  DBP 
mmHg  Confirm diagnosis  
Grade 1  140-159 90-99 After 3 months of life style modification  
Grade 2  160-179 100-109 Same visit  
Grade 3  >180 >110 Same visit  
Consider secondary hypertension with identifiable cause in young patients < 40 years or elderly 
patient > 60 years presenting for first time with hypertension.  
Note  
• Recommend an alternative contraceptive method for women using oestrogen containing oral
contraceptive.
• Evidence of end organ damage, i.e. cardiomegaly, proteinuria or uraemia, retinopathy orevidence of stroke, dictates immediate treatment.
Treatm ent goal of Hypertension 
• In patients aged 18 - 59 years without major comorbidities, and in patients 60 years or older
who have diabetes, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or both conditions, the blood pressure goal
level should be <140/90 mm Hg.
• In patients aged 60 years or older who do not have diabetes or chronic kidney disease, t he
blood pressure goal level should be <150/90 mm Hg.
Non-pharmacological Treatment 
Lifestyl e modification: 
• Lifestyle modification (refer to table 20.2)

20.9 Heart Failure 
Heart Failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e. g. elevated jugular venous pressure, 
pulmonary crackles and peripheral oedema) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac 
abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or 
during stress.  
Heart Failure in Pregnancy  
Symptoms and signs of heart failure in a pregnant woman are an indication for urgent assessment to 
establish a diagnosis and appropriate management. This is best accomplished through a 
multidisciplinary approach in which both cardiologists and obstetricians need to participate in order to 
provide expert counselling and care in pursuit of safe motherhood, as well as to exclude underlying cause of heart failure.  455	Acute Heart Failure (AHF) or Decompensated Acute Heart Failure (ADHF)  
AHF is defined as rapid or gradual onset of signs and symptoms of heart failure that results in urgent 
unplanned hospitalization or Emergency Medicine Department visits. The clinical signs and 
symptoms are significantly life threatening if the above features occu r in patients with established 
diagnosis with structurally heart disease categorized as Acute Decompensated Heart Failure 
(ADHF). The cause and immediate precipitating factor(s) of the AHF must be identified and treated to 
prevent further damage to the hea rt. 
Non-pharmacological Treatment:  
Oxygen therapy and/or ventilatory support. 
• Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation includes both CPAP and bi –level positive
pressure ventilation (PPV)
• Mechanical ventilation
Note  
In AHF, oxygen should not be used r outinely in non –hypoxaemic patients, as it causes 
vasoconstriction and a reduction in cardiac output  
Pharmacological treatment  
Recommendations for the management of patients with acute heart failure: 
Diuretics : Diuretics are a cornerstone in the treat ment of patients with AHF. In patients with new -
onset AHF or those with chronic, decompensated HF not receiving oral diuretics the initial 
recommended dose should be 20– 40 mg intravenous furosemide (or equivalent); for those on 
chronic diuretic therapy, in itial intravenous dose should be at least equivalent to oral dose.  
Diuretics should either be given as intermittent boluses or as a continuous infusion, and the dose and 
duration should be adjusted according to patients’ symptoms and clinical status. Comb ination of loop 
diuretic with either thiazide -type diuretic or spironolactone may be considered  
Loop diuretic  
B: furosemide (IV) 20 –120mg 24hourly  
OR 
S: torsemide (PO) 5 –20mg 24hourly  
AND

C: spironol actone (PO) 25 –50mg 24hourly 
OR 
S: eplerenone (PO) 25 –50mg 24hourly  
Vasodilators: these are the cornerstone of treatment of AHF and have dual benefit by decreasing 
venous tone (to optimize preload) and arterial tone (decrease afterload). Consequent ly, they increase 
stroke volume  
Intravenous vasodilators should be considered for symptomatic relief in AHF with SBP >90 mmHg 
(and without symptomatic hypotension). Symptoms and blood pressure should be monitored 
frequently during administration of intrave nous vasodilators. In patients with hypertensive AHF, 
intravenous vasodilators should be considered as initial therapy to improve symptoms and reduce 
congestion. Intravenous vasodilators for treating AHF are described in table 20.4.  
Note  
Vasodilators shou ld be used with caution in patients with significant mitral or aortic stenosis.  
Consider oral vasodilators in case intravenous vasodilator not available or unavailability of intensive 
care or high dependent unit care.

treatment with another inotrope, to increase blood pressure and vital organ perfusion. Dosage see 
table 20.5 below  
Indication: Patients with cardiogenic shock, desp ite treatment with another inotrope, to increase 
blood pressure and vital organ perfusion.

(HDUs) are available.  
20.10   Chronic Heart Failure 
Patients who have had HF as defined above for some time are often said to have ‘Chronic Heart 
Failure’. A treated patient with symptoms and signs that have remained generally unchanged for  at 
least 1 month is said to be ‘Stable chronic heart failure’  
Diagnostic Criteria  
The diagnosis of chronic heart failure requires the following features:  
• Symptoms of heart failure, typically breathlessness or fatigue, at rest or during exertion
• Objectiv e evidence of cardiac dysfunction preferably by Echocardiography (Systolic and/or
Diastolic)
• A clinical response to treatment is supportive but not sufficient for diagnosis.457	Hence diagnosis and management of CHF should be sought at referral centres where at least 
echocardiography assessment can be performed.  
Treatment of Systolic Heart Failure (LVEF< 45 –50%)  
Goals of treatment  
• Prevention of disease leading to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure eg hypertension,
coronary artery disease, valve disease etc.
• To achieve maintenance or improvement in quality of life and improve survival
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Avoid excessive fluid intake in severe HF Limit fluid intake to 1 –1.5 L/day if fluid overl oaded
despite diuretic therapy.
• Regular exercise within  limits of symptoms and other lifestyle modification (refer to table
20.2).
Note  
Sexual counselling regarding the risk of pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives and 
phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitors (e.g sildenafil) are not recommended in advanced HF, if used 
nitrates should be avoided <24 –48hours of nitrate intakes.  
Medicines to avoid or to be used with caution.

• Inotropic support if SBP<90mmHg
• Dialysis if renal failure
Note  
• All patients suspected with pulmonary oedema s hould be referred to high level of
care where hospital resourced with high care dependent unit or intensive care unit.
• Patient should be stabilized first at low level of care before referral to the high level
of care.
20.12 Infective Endocarditis (IE)  
The infective process of endocardial layer of the heart can involve native or prosthetic valve and 
congenital defects/shunts. Alpha –haemolytic streptococci are the most common causes of native 
valve endocarditis but Staphylococcus aureus is more likely if t he disease is rapidly progressive with 
high fever or is related to a prosthetic valve (Staphylococcus epidermidis).  
Diagnostic Criteria  
Use Modified Dukes Criteria below and consult microbiologist where possible. Three sets of blood 
cultures should be ta ken before starting treatment.  
Modified Dukes Criteria  
Major Criteria  
• Positive blood cultures of typical organism for IE from at least two separate blood cultures
• Evidence of endocardial involvement by echocardiogram (Trans– thoracic Echo/Trans–
oesophageal Echo)
Minor Criteria  
• Fever > 38ºC
• Presence of Rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease
• Vascular phenomena; Major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm,
intracranial haemorrhage, conjuctival hemorrhage, Janeway lesions
• Immu nological phenomena; glomerulonephritis, Osler`s nodes, Roth`s spots,
• Rheumatoid factor.
• Serologic evidence of active infective endocarditis or blood culture not meeting major
criterion.
Definition of infective endocarditis according to the modified Duke criteria:  
Definitive diagnosis of IE  
Pathological criteria  
• Microorganisms  demonstrated by culture or on histological examination of a vegetation, a
vegetation that has embolized, or an intracardiac abscess specim en
OR
• Pathological lesions:  vegetation o r intracardiac abscess confirmed by histological
examination showing active endocarditis.
Clinical criteria 
• Two major criteria OR
• One major and three minor criteria OR
• Five minor criteria459	Possible Diagnosis of IE  
• One major and one minor OR
• Three minor criteria
Rejected IE 
Firm alternate diagnosis. 
• Resolution of symptoms suggesting IE with antibiotic therapy for ≤4 days; or
• No pathological evidence of IE at surgery or autopsy, with antibiotic therapy for ≤4 days;
OR
• Does not meet criteria for possible IE, as above.
Note  
• Positive blood cultures rema in the cornerstone of diagnosis and provide live bacteria for both
identiﬁcation and susceptibility testing .
• To improve yield of culturing bacteria at least three blood sample sets are taken at 30
minutes apart each containing 10mL of blood and should be incubated in both aerobic and
anaerobic atmospheres.
• Sampling should be obtained from a peripheral vein using a meticulous sterile technique.
Pharmacological Treatment 
Empirical Treatment  
Consider for negative blood culture or if risk delaying treatme nt for blood culture outweigh the befit of

prosthetic material was used for cardiac valve repair.
• Patients with a previous episode of IE.
• Patients with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD):
I. Any type of cyanotic CHD.
II. Any type of CHD repaired with a prosthetic material, whether place surgically or by
percutaneous techniques, up to 6 months after the procedure or lifelong if residual
shunt or valvular regurgitation remains.
Note  
Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended in other forms of valvular or CHD.  
Prophylaxis of Endocarditis Infective 
• To reduce the risk of bacterial endocarditis, antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to patients
undergoing dental procedures requiring manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of t he
teeth or perforation of the ora l mucosa .
Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for,  
• Respiratory tract procedures including bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy, or trans nasal orendotracheal intubation
• Gastrointestinal or urogenital procedures or Trans –oesophageal Echocardiogram, gastros copy,
colonoscopy, cystoscopy, vaginal or caesarean delivery.

20.13 Acute Rheumatic Fever  
It is a non –suppurative sequela of a group A ß haemolyt ic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngeal 
infection.  
Diagnostic Criteria Jones  See table 20.7 below 
Definitive Diagnosis  
• Two major criteria or
• One major criterion with two minor criteria, with evidence of antecedent streptococcal
infection
Table 20.7: Criteria  for Acute Rheumatic Fever Diagnosis  
Major Criteria  Minor Criteria  
1. Carditis  
2. Migratory polyarthritis  
3. Sydenham’s chorea 
4. Erythema Marginatum  1. Clinical  
• Fever  
• Arthralgia  
2. Laboratory  
• Elevated Acute Phase Reactants eg CRP  
• Prolonged PR interval
Plus 
Supporting evi dence of recent group, A streptococcal infection e.g. positive throat culture or antigen 
detection and/or elevated streptococcal antibody tests*  
*anti –streptolysin O, anti – deoxyribonuclease B461	Non–pharmacological Treatment  
Acute stage:  
• Bed rest and sup portive care until all evidence of active carditis has resolved
• Patient education.
• Intensive health education for prevention of sore throats.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Treatment of acute attack for eradication of streptococci in throat: Regardless of the presence or 
absence of pharyngitis at the time of diagnosis. 
A: benzathine penicillin (IM) 1.2MU stat  
Paediatric> 5 years 0.3MU, 5– 10 years 0.6 MU > 10 years 1.2 MU stat  
OR 
A: penicillin V (PO) 500mg 8 -12 hourly 24 hourly for 10days 
Children > 10years 500 mg, 5 –10 years 250mg, < 5years 125mg (PO) 8 -12 hourly for 10 
days  
Patients allergic to penicillin  
A: erythromycin (PO) 500mg or 40mg/kg 6hourly for 10days. 
Treatment of Acute Arthritis and Carditis:  
A: acetylsalicyclic acid (PO) 25mg/kg 6hourly 24hourly  as required.  
Acetylsalicyclic acid should be continued until fever, all signs of joint inflammation and 
the ESR have returned to normal and then tapered gradually over 2 weeks. If symptoms recur, full doses should be restarted. *dose should be reduced if tinnitus or other toxic 
symptoms develop  
In severe carditis with development of increasing heart failure or failure of response to aspirin, Add
A: prednisolone (PO) 1 –2mg/kg 24hourly for 3 –4weeks  
Then review and gradual reduction and discontinuation of prednisolone may be started after 3 –4 
weeks when there has been a substantial reduction in clinical disease. 
Heart failure  should be managed in the usual way (see Heart Failure Section 20.9).  
Treatment of Sydenham’s chorea:  
B: haloperidol( PO) 1.5 –3mg 8hourly for 24 hours as required (Adult). 
Paediatrics 50 µg/kg for 24 hours in 2 divided doses.  
Referral:  Ideally all patients should be referred to high level of care a specialized hospital care, 
where surgery is contemplated  
Antibiotic prophylaxis after r heumatic fever  
Prophylaxis should be given to all patients with a history of acute rheumatic fever and to those with 
rheumatic heart valve lesions. The optimum duration of prophylaxis should be up to at least 21years of age.  
Note  
Specific situations requi ring prophylaxis for longer periods (up to 30years as a guide):  
• definitive carditis in previous attacks
• high risk of exposure to streptococcal infection at home or work (crowded conditions,
high exposure to children)
Medicine of choice  
A: benzathine peni cillin (IM) 2.4MU monthly or every three weeks*  
Paediatrics <12yrs 1.2MU every 4 weeks or 3 weeks* up to 21 –30yrs

Paediatric<12yr 125 –250mg 12hourly for 24hours up to 21 –30years  
OR 
A: erythromycin ( PO) 250mg 12hourly for 24hours Adult  462	Paediatric <12yr 125 –250mg 12hourlyfor 24hours up to 21 –30yrs *every 3week regimen is 
more effective  
Valvular Heart Disease and Congenital Structural Heart Disease  
Valvular Heart Disease  are chronic acquired sequelae of Acute Rheumatic Fever or Acute Sequelae 
of Infective Endorcaditis or Ischaemic Heart Disease, consisting of valvular damage, usually left heart 
valves, with varied progression of severity and complications.  
Congenital Heart Disease  is a congenital chamber defects or vessel wall anomalies  
Valvular Heart Disease and Congenital Structural Heart Disease may be complicated by:  
• Heart failure
• Infective endocarditis
• Atrial fibrillation
• Systemic embolism eg Stroke
General measures  
• Advise all patients with a heart murmur regarding the need for prophylaxis treatment prior
to undergoing certain medical and dental procedures.
• Advise patients to inform health care providers of the presence of the heart murmur whenreporting for medical or dental treatment
Referral : Sho uld be considered from low level of care to high level of care where specialized 
(physician`s care) or super –specialized care (Cardiologist`s care) can be offered  
20.14 Pulmonary Embolism  
20.14.1   Acute Pulmonary Embolism  
Clinical Spectrum less than two weeks  
• Sudden onset of dyspnoea often with unexplained anxiety (most common)
• Pleuritic chest pain and haemoptysis
• Massive embolism: pleuritic chest pain, cyanosis, right heart failure and shock. Minoremboli or pulmonary infarction may herald massive emboli sm and must be treated
vigorously
• About 90% of emboli are from proximal leg deep vein thromboses (DVTs) or pelvic vein
thromboses. DVTs are at risk for dislodging and migrating to the lung circulation. Thus
,
termed as venous thromboembolism (VTE).
Diagnos tic Criteria  
Determination pre- test probability of PE 
Use validated scoring system: Wells Score  
• Score > 6.0 –High clinical probability proceeds with imaging test to confirm PE and treat,
• Score 2.0 to 6.0 –Moderate clinical probability; negative D –dimer, P E is excluded and D –
dimer positive, obtain imaging tests to confirm based on result treat.
• Score < 2.0 –Low clinical probability negative D –dimer, PE is excluded. Positive D –dimer
obtain imaging tests to confirm or rule out and based on result treat
Alter natively 
• Score > 4 –PE likely, d– dimer positive proceeds with diagnostic imaging to confirm and treat
PE.
• Score 4 or less –PE unlikely, consider d –dimer to rule out PE.
Table 20.8: Wells Score  
Variable Score 
Clinically suspected DVT  3.0 points  
alternati ve diagnosis is less likely than PE  3.0 points  
Tachycardia (heart rate > 100) 1.5 points  
Immobilization ( ≥ 3d)/surgery in previous four weeks 1.5 points  
History of DVT or PE 1.5 points  
Hemoptysis 1.0 points  
Malignancy (with treatment within six mo nths) or palliative 1.0 points  463	• ECG – Not reliable test for diagnosis may be normal. However,
• Sinus tachycardia most common feature, acute right ventricular strain – i.e. right axis sh ift,
S1Q3T3 occurs in small percentage of cases, may develop acute bu ndle branch block –
right or left, may simulate right ventricular infarction, may develop arrhythmias – eg atrial
fibrillation
• Arterial blood gases; not diagnostic, the pO 2 decreased <60mmHg due ventilation/perfusi on
mismatch. pCO 2 decreased due to hyperve ntilation, pH increased but may decrease i n
shocked patient
• D–dimer test – very sensitive blood test, but not specific. A negative test d– dimer test
excludes an embolus in majority of cases (best exclusive test to rule out PE when is
negative)
• Chest X– ray – Not very reliable usually normal, diaphragm may be raised on affected area,
atelectasis may occur, peripheral wedge –shaped shadow & plural effusion
• Cardiac Echocardiography: Useful in diagnosis, features suggestive or support
• evidence of massive embol us acute right ventricular strain
• Computer Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram Scan (CTPA); Useful can demonstrate the
presence and extent of proximal pulmonary emboli
• Ventilation/Perfusion Scan; Useful in stable patient to confirm the diagnosis. The presenceof a perfusion defect with normal ventilation not corresponding to an x –ray abnormality is
characteristic
• Pulmonary Angiography: Still gold standard investigation, may be necessary to establish
• Diagnosis and catheter -based embolectomy in the catheterization  lab.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Administer O
2 – maintain pO 2 > 60mmHg,
• Treat shock
• Correct electrolyte & acid base abnormalities and arrhythmias
• Ventilate if patient in respiratory failure
Pharmacological Treatment 
Anticoagulation  
B: unfractionated heparin (UFH) (IV) 10,000units then maintenance infusion starts with 
6,000U over 6 hours to keep PTT or clotting time 2 –3times above baseline. PTT should 
be performed 12hourly per lab instruction.  
OR 
S: low molecular weight heparin (SC) 1mg/kg 12hourly for  24hours  
Start warfarin after 24hours of heparin and continue post discharge for long– term. If the aetiology 
unknown may be for life, if aetiology is established at least for six months. Maintain INR 2.0 –3.0 
Thrombolytic (Fibrinolysis)  
Indicated in proxi mal massive pulmonary emboli and haemodynamically unstable if no 
contraindication exists  
S: streptokinase (IV)250,000IU over 30minutes, then 100,000IU per hour for 24hours  
OR 
S: alteplase (rtPA) (IV) 100mg over 2hours  
Referral: All cases suspected of pulm onary embolus should be referred to a high level of care – 
specialized hospital care with HCDU/ICU  
20.14.2 Chronic Pulmonary Embolism  
Chronic pulmonary embolism is mainly a consequence of incomplete resolution of acute pulmonary 
thromboembolism . Clinically symptoms and signs may be preceded by Acute Pulmonary Embolism 
for more than 2weeks.  
Pharmacological Treatment 
Long- term oral anticoagulation 
C:warfarin(PO) 2– 10mg 24hourly 
OR 
S: rivaroxaban (PO) 15 -20mg 24hourly  464	Maintain INR 2.0 –3.0 for warfarin use individuals.  
Referral: All cases suspected of pulmonary embolism should be referred to a high level of care  
20.15   Cardiac Arrhythmias/ Dysrhythmias 
Always exclude underlying struc tural cardiac disease in all patients with cardiac dysrhythmias as well 
as performing Holter ECG monitoring aiding at detecting type of arrhythmia.  
20.15.1 Tachyarrythmias 
20.15.1.1 Narrow QRS Complex Tachyarrythmias (SVTs)  
Definition Sustained (> 30 seconds) or non –sustained narrow QRS ( ≤ 0.1 seconds) tachycardias.  
Atrial Fibrillation  
Acute onset (< 48 hours)  
• Assess clinically, e.g. heart failure, mitral stenosis, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, age and
other medical conditions.
• Consider anticoagulation w ith heparin or warfarin.
• Synchronized DC cardioversion is occasionally necessary in emergency especiallyhaemodynamic instability or consider if is the first episode.
Non-acute/chronic (> 48 hours)  
• As above, but not immediate DC cardioversion is indicated, unless in hypotensiveemergency cases. Anticoagulation with oral warfarin 2 -5mg orally once a day for at least 
a
month, then perform elective cardioversion at specialized hospital.
Atrial flutter  
• P waves visible before QRS, commonly occurs, usually 2:1.  (150 per minute). P waves,
usually negative in Lead II precede QRS, blocked P in ST segment or hidden by QRS.
• Vagal stimulation with ECG may reveal blocked P waves.
AV Junctional Re -Entry Tachycardias 
Usually paroxysmal, often young with normal heart.  
• AV nodal re- entry or WPW syndrome. P waves usually not visible (hidden by QRS).
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Electrical Cardioversion.  
Synchronized DC cardioversion, 200 J, after sedation with:  
A: diazepam (IV)10 –20 mg stat 
If flutter has been present lon ger than 48hours, defer cardioversion for 4weeks after anticoagulation 
with warfarin, unless severe symptoms or heart failure requires urgent cardioversion. 
Pharmacological Treatment  
None is nearly as effective as DC cardioversion.  
Consider anticoagulants  if Atrial flutter sustained.  
Long term treatment: Recurrent atrial flutter is an indication for referral. Many can be cured by 
radiofrequency catheter ablation.  
Atrial tachycardias 
• Rare, often incessant P before QRS (often long PR) or hidden in T
• May caus e heart failure (tachycardia cardiomyopathy).
Atrial fibrillation  
I. With fast ventricular response without abberant conduction .
Pharmacological Treatment, Initial:  
Anticoagulation with warfarin 
OR 
S: rivaroxaban (PO)15 -20mg 24hourly  (in Non -valvular AF)  
Rate control (Control the ventricular rate with one of the following): 
D: digoxin (IV) Initial dose: 0.25 -0.5mg; then 0.25mg 4- 6hourly to maximum of 1mg; 
Maintenance dose: 0.125 -0.25mg 24hourly (IV)  or (PO) (Digoxin0.25mg (PO) daily; use 
only in heart fail ure).  465	OR 
B: atenolol (PO) 50 –100mg 24hourly (contraindicated in asthmatics).  
OR 
D: diltiazem (IV) initial dose: 15- 20mg over 2minutes; may repeat in 15 minutes, 
Maintenance dose: 5 -15mg hourly by continuous IV infusion  
OR 
S: verapamil (IV) 5 to 10 mg  over 2minutes; may repeat in 30minutes 
DC cardioversion in selected cases, after 4weeks of anticoagulation  
Digoxin only controls rate at rest and is insufficient on its own. If used for long -term, combine with β –
blocker:  
D: digoxin (PO) 0.125 -0.25mg 24hourly 
In the elderly and patients with renal impairment: Adjust dosages according to trough levels within the 
therapeutic range. Do levels only if the patient has been on the drug for at least 10 days.  
AND / OR 
B: atenolol (PO) 50 –100 mg 24hourly 
OR 
S: bisoprolol (PO) 2.5mg – 10mg 24hourly 
OR  
C: metoprolol (PO) 25mg -50mg 24hourly 
OR 
S: sotalol (PO) 80mg – 160mg 12hourly  
Note  
Avoid use of Digoxin in patients with Accessory pathway.  
II. With fast ventricular response with Aberrant conduction (eg: Wolff -Parkinson -White
syndrome, WPW)
Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway in symptomatic patients with preexcited AF, especially if 
the accessory pathway has a short refractory period that allow s rapid antegrade conduction.  
Long – term  
• Continue warfarin anticoagulation long- term, unless contraindicated :
C:warfarin (PO) 5mg 24hourly
OR
S: rivaroxaban (PO) maintance dose; 15mg / 20mg 24hourly
OR
Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO).
Note  
• INR monitoring in patients on warfarin. Maintain therapeutic Range INR 2 –3: Stable patients
check 3 monthly. If INR < 1.5 or > 3.5: do monthly monitoring.
• Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is indicated in Atrial Fibrillation patients who can not
tolerate  long-term Anticoagulantion or contraindicated to OACs (Oral anticoagulants) and
have thrombo -embolic risk (CHA 2DS 2-VASc score ≥ 2), increased risk of bleeding (HASBLED
score ≥ 3) and thrombo -embolic events despite adequate OAC after excluding other
plausible causes (eg carotid disease) .
20.15.2   AV Junctional Re -Entry Tachycardias 
 
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Vagal manoeuvres: Valsalva or carotid sinus massage. The patient should be supine and as relaxed 
as possible, to avoid competing sympathetic re flex 
Pharmacological Treatment  
If vagal manoeuvres fail:  
S:adenosine (IV) 6mg over 1 -3 seconds (maybe given IO) followed by rapid flush with 
20mL NS, if no conversion within 1 -2minutes give 12mg, repeat a second time if necessary 
(30mg total)  
If none of t he above is effective, and patient is hypotensive, consider DC shock  466	Prevention of recurrent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  
Only in patients with severe symptoms despite the above measures:  
S: amiodarone (PO) 200mg 8hourly for 1week, followed by 200mg 12h ourly for one 
week and thereafter 200mg 24hourly. Specialist initiated.  
Precautions : 
• Halve dosage of warfarin and monitor INR closely if patient on warfarin, until stable
• Avoid concomitant digoxin use.
Note  
Verapamil and digoxin are contraindicated in W PW syndrome.  
Long- term treatment: Teach the patient to perform vagal manoeuvres, Valsalva is the most 
effective. For infrequent, non –incapacitating symptoms:  
ß –Blockers 
B: atenolol (PO) 50 –100mg 24hourly (If asthmatic)  
OR 
S: verapamil (PO) 80 –120mg 8hourly for 24hours (Normal heart)  
Referral: Refer to Cardiac specialized center for Mapping and Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA)  
20.15.3   Wide QRS (Ventricular) Tachyarrhythmias (VTs)  
Sustained (> 30 seconds) or non -sustained wide QRS (> 0.12 seconds) tach ycardias 
Regular Wide QRS Tachycardias  
These are ventricular tachycardias until proved otherwise. Regular wide QRS supraventricular 
tachycardias are uncommon.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Refer all cases after resuscitation and stabilization. Emergency  DC cardioversion is mandatory with a 
full protocol of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)  
• If no cardiac arrest: DC cardioversion, 200J, after sedation with: Diazepam, I.V, 10 –20mg If
200J fails, use 360J.
• If cardiac arrest: Defibrillate (not synchronized) .
Pharmacological Treatment  
DC cardioversion is first line therapy for regular wide QRS tachycardias.  
Medicines are needed if VT recurs after cardioversion or if spontaneous termination/recurrence.  
S: amiodarone (IV) 5mg/kg (150 -300mg) infused over 30min utes then continue with 
maintenance dose to total dose of 1200mg/24hours  
OR  
S: amiodarone (PO)800 mg 24hourly for 7days, 600mg/day for 3days followed by a 
maintenance dose of 200 –400mg/day  
Amiodarone may cause serious long -term side effects due to long half-life. Therefore, patients 
require regular monitoring by specialist.  
A: lidocaine (IV) 50 –100mg (1 –2mg/kg) initially and at 5minute intervals if required to a total 
of 200– 300mg,   
Thereafter, for recurrent ventricular tachycardia only  
A: lidocaine (I V)1–3mg/minute for 24– 30hours. lidocaine will only terminate ± 30% of 
sustained ventricular tachycardias, and may cause hypotension, heart block or convulsions.  
Note  
• Never give verapamil IV to patients with a wide QRS tachycardia.
• For emergency treatment of ventricular tachycardia, DC cardioversion is first– line therapy ,
even if stable.
Sustained (> 30 Sec) Irregular Wide QRS Tachycardias  
They are usually due to atrial fibrillation with bundle branch block, or pre -excitation (WPW syndrome).  467	Non-pharmac ological/P harmacological Treatment 
• If the QRS complexes have a pattern of typical right or left bundle branch block, with a rate
< less than 170/minute, treat as for atrial fibrillation. See the section on atrial fibrillation.
• If the rate is > 170 per min ute, and/or the complexes are atypical or variable, the likel y
diagnosis is WPW syndrome with atrial fibrillation, conducting via the bypass tract, DCconversion.
Referral: Refer patient to high care centre for further management including arrhythmia mapp ing and 
RFA 
Non-Sustained (< 30 Sec) Irregular Wide QRS Tachycardias  
They are usually ventricular, commonly in acute myocardial infarction . In acute myocardial infarction, 
only treat non –sustained ventricular tachycardia if causes significant haemodynamic  compromise. 
Ensure the serum potassium level is above 4 mmol/L.  
Pharmacological Treatment  
Medicines are needed if VT recurs after cardioversion or if spontaneous termination/recurrence.  
S: amiodarone (IV) 5 mg/kg (150 -300mg) over 30minutes then continue with maintenance 
dose to total dose of 1200mg for24hours  
OR  
S: amiodarone (PO) 800mg 24hourly for 7days, followed by 600mg 24hourly for 3 days 
then a maintenance dose of 200 –400mg 24hourly  
Only in a haemodynamically stable patient:  
A: lidocaine (IV) 50 –100mg (1– 2mg/kg) initially and at 5minute intervals if required to a total 
of 200– 300mg  
Thereafter, for recurrent ventricular tachycardia only:  
A: lidocaine (IV) 1 –3mg/minute for 24 –30hours  
In the absence of acute ischaemia or infarction, consider torsade’ s de pointes.  
Torsade’s De Pointes Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)  
• Has a twisting pattern to the QRS complexes and a prolonged QT interval in sinus rhythm,it is usually due to a QT –prolonging drug, ± hypokalaemia.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Cardioversio n/defibrillation, as necessary.
• Torsade’s complicating bradycardia: temporary pacing
Pharmacological Treatment  
Stop all QT- prolonging drugs. Correct serum potassium.  
A: magnesium sulphate (IV) 2g over 5 –10minutes  
If recurrent episodes after initial dose o f magnesium sulphate:  
A: magnesium sulphate (IV) 2g over 24hours  
Torsade’s complicating bradycardia: temporary pacing.  
A: adrenaline infusion to raise heart rate to >100 per minute  
(if temporary pacing unavailable).  
Referral: Refer a ll cases of wide QRS ta chycardia, after resuscitation and stabilization for possible 
arrhythmia mapping and RFA.  
20.16 Heart Block (Second and Third Degree)  
Most cases occur in patients over 60 years and is idiopathic. Acute, reversible AV block commonly 
complicated by inferior  myocardial infarction, here temporary Pacemaker used as bridge therapy. 
The condition may also be induced by medicines, metabolic and electrolyte derrangments.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Emergency cardio -pulmonary resuscitation.
• External pacemaker sho uld be available in all secondary hospitals and must be prec eded
by appropriate analgesia.
 Pharmacological Treatment  
Analgesia if external pacemaker:  468	C: morphine (IM)10 –15mg 3– 6hourly 
For Temporary treatment of complete AV block before referral for pace maker:  
A: atropine (IV) bolus 0.6 –1.2mg every 3 – 5min (max 3mg) may be repeated until a 
temporary or permanent pacemaker is inserted.  
(Use in an Inferior Infarct patients, hypotension, and second -degree AV block).  
For resuscitation of asystole:  
A: adrenaline (IV) 1:10000, slow 5mL (0.5mg)  
Referral  
• All cases with a heart rate below 40 beats/minute after resuscitation and stabilization to
high level of care where permanent pacemaker implantation can be performed.
• All cases of second or third -degree AV blo ck, whether myocardial infarct or other reversible
cause is suspected, and whether the patient is thought to be symptomatic.
Note  
Complete Heart Block Is a Medical Emergency Refer Urgently  
20.17 Sinus Bradycardia & Sinus Arrest  
This rhythm does not req uire treatment, unless they are causing symptoms, i.e. syncope, dizziness, 
tiredness, and poor effort tolerance. Sinus bradycardia <50/minute or sinus arrest with slow escape 
rhythm, accompanied by hypotension, strongly suggests a treatable underlying caus e: 
• Acute inferior myocardial infarct
• Hyperkalaemia, especially if wide QRS and/or peaked T waves
• Drugs, especially combination of verapamil and ß –blocker or digoxin
• Hypothermia
• Hypoxia
Treat the cause. Consider atropine if inferior infarct.  
Note  
• Refer th e patient After stabilization to the Cardiac Specialized centre for thor ough
evaluation and Pacemaker Implantation [Temporary/Permanent Pacemaker
Implantation (single or Dual chamber) depending on the underlying cause], prepareVancomycin injection for ste rilization of Permanent Pacemaker pouch.469	CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE  
KIDNEY AND UROLOGICAL DISORDERS 
These are disorders resulting from structural malformation or function of the genitourinary system that 
may lead to kidney impairment. These disorders include diseases originating from the kidney and 
systemic diseases, which result in complications affecting the kidney. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the commonest conditions causing complications in the kidney, therefore all patients with 
hypertension and diabetes mellitus should be regularly screened for kidney complications.  
21.1 Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD)  
It is structural or functional kidney damage present for >3months, with or without a decreased 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Early screening  in high -risk groups [hypertension, Diabetes and 
glomerular diseases] is crucial in improving outcome of CKD. Once cause and plan for care has been established, adults with early CKD stages 0 -3 can be managed at primary care level.  
Clinical Presentation  
Clinical features depend on the stage of kidney disease. In advance stage includes:  
• Anorexia
• Malaise• Vomiting
• Oliguria/anuria
Investigations  
• Kidney function tests (serum creatinine and urea)  - at diagnosis check every month for
3months. If active sedimen t/proteinuria, provider may check more frequently
• FBC (HB)
• Urinalysis (Protein, red blood cells and cast cells) then quantify the amount of protein in
urine by Esbach test or Urine albumin -creatinine ration or Urine protein -creatinine ratio
• Kidney -Ureter -Bladder (KUB) ultrasound
• CXR
• ECG
• Serum electrolytes Potassium, Calcium Phosphate and Sodium [CKD stage 3 -5: Check
monthly]
• Serum albumin (for corrected calcium)
• Serum bicarbonate levels (venous) [CKD stage 3- 5: Check monthly]
• Parathyroid hormone levels, Ser um Phosphate and Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) [CKD
stage 5 on dialysis]
Note  
Cause of CKD should be determined and addressed. Especially when thinking of kidney 
transplantation  
The general management of the patient with chronic kidney disease involves the f ollowing issues  
• Treatment of reversible causes of kidney dysfuncti on
• Preventing or slowing the progression of kidney disease
• Treatment of the complications of kidney dysfuncti on
• Identification and adequate preparation of the patient in whom kidney repl acement ther apy
will be required

*Use CKD -EPI formula without th e ethnicity factor. This calculator is available freely online.
Laboratories in Tanzania should report as eGFR.(Delanaye and Mariat, 2013) [1, 2]
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Reduce salt intake.
• Low protein diet (not exceed 1g/kg per day) is indicated in the presence of CKD stage 4
and 5. (Evidence)
• Reduce cardiovascular disease risk factors – See section: Prevention of ischaemic heart
disease and atherosclerosis.
• Treat underlying conditions.
• Decrease significant proteinuria, if present.
Significant proteinuria = more tha n +2 protein on urinalysis OR spot urine protein creatinine ratio of > 
0.1 g/mmol OR ACR (albumin -creatinine ratio) > 100 g/mol, confirm as positive if raised on at least 2 
of 3 occasions, in the absence of infection, cardiac failure and menstruation.  
Proteinuria  
• In established chronic kidney disease, decrease proteinuria, irrespective of presence or
absence of systemic hypertension.
• Monitor kidney function and potassium especially with impaired kidney function.
• If volume depleted, first rehydrate befor e commencing ACE -inhibitor .
• ACE- inhibitor are contraindicated in :
ü Hyperkalaemia
ü known allergy to ACE- inhibitor
Begin with low dosage of ACE -inhibitor and titrate up ensuring blood pressure remains in normal 
range and no side effects are present, up to t he maximum dose or until the proteinuria disappears – 
whichever comes first.  
Pharmacological Treatment  
Adults  
C: enalapril (PO) 10 –20mg 12hourly  
OR 
C: lisinopril (PO) 5 -10mg 24hourly (titrate max 40mg 24hourly)  
Also see other ACEI in hypertension trea tment (Cardiovascular Chapter)  
Hyperlipidaemia 
If hyperlipidaemia is a co- existent risk factor manage according to section 
21.1.1Diabetic Kidney Disease  
This is a clinical diagnosis based on the presence of albuminuria, decreased estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR) or both in diabetes. This diagnosis includes diabetic nephropathy which has 471	microalbuminuria (30 -300mg/g) and retinopathy in its defining characteristics. In diabetics, optimise 
control according to section 9.6: Diabetes mellitus type 2, in adults.  
Investigations  
• Urinalysis (Dipstick biochemistry + microscopy)
• Kidney biopsy with the following indications – if cause not apparent
o Albuminuria >300mg/g within 5years of DMt1 onset
o RBC cell cast, dysmorphic RBC or WBC casts in urine sedimen t
o Presence of other systemic illness eg SLE
o Rapid decline (per year) of eGFR>5mL/min/1.73m2
• Ultrasonography kidney ureter and bladder (KUB)

21.2 Acute Kidney Disease  
Acute kidney disease is a sudden decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) resulting elevation of 
serum blood ure a, creatinine and other waste products. Practically AKI is recognized when there is 
urine output of less than 0.5ml/kg/hour for >6 hours. Causes of AKI are classified as pre -renal, renal 
and post -renal causes and usually result in reversible kidney failure , these causes include;  
Table 21.4:  Causes  of acute kidney injury  
Category  Examples  Intervention  
Pre-renal: loss of effective 
blood flow to the kidneys  Low blood volume  
• Diarrhea, burn, 
acute blood loss  
Heart failure  
Hepatic failure  Restore blood vol ume 
• IV fluids
Low blood pressure  
• Use of inotropes
Renal: caused by intrinsic 
kidney insult  -Glomerulonephritis
-Nephrotoxic medications
-Rhabdomyolysis
-Tumor lysis syndromeTreatment of specific  
Glomerular disorders  
Omit offending nephrotoxic drug s 
Post renal: occurs as a 
consequence of 
urinary  obstruction  -BPH
-Urinary stones
-Obstructed urinary catheters
-Bladder stonesRelief of obstruction 
-Urinary catheterization
-Nephrostomy
Clinical Presentation  
• Oedema
• Oluguria/anuria
• Convulsions in c hildren
Investigation  
Early disease  
• Creatinine [ increase of ≥ 26micromol/l within 48hrs or ≥ 50% increase within 7 days
defines AKI]
• Urea477	• Ultrasound KUB
• Urinalysis (Dipstick and microscopy)
Advanced disease defined by urine output of less than 0.5ml/kg /hour for >12 hours.  
• Serum electrolytes [potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, Sodium phosphate and calcium]
• Arterial Blood Gases
• Uric acid
• Urine electrolytes – Fractional excretion of Sodium

• ECG
• Kidney biopsy if cause not obvious clinically
• Creati ne kinase if Rhabdomyolysis is suspected
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Give oxygen, and nurse in semi -Fowlers’ position if patient has respiratory distress.
• Stop intake of all salt and potassium containing foods and fluids
• Restrict fluid intake to 10 mL /kg/day daily plus visible fluid losses
• Remove nephrotoxic medications
• Adequate nutritional support: sufficient amounts of energy and adequate protein. Consider
enteric/parenteral nutrition
Pharmacological Treatment  
Treat underlying cause  
Adults  
If deh ydrated, 
A: 0.9% sodium chloride (PO/IV) while monitoring urine output 
If diastolic blood pressure is greater than 100 mmHg  or systolic blood pressure is above 150 
mmHg :  
C: amlodipine (PO) 5 mg 
If there is respiratory distress (rapid respiration, orthop noea) and is fluid overloaded [chest crackles 
and raised JVP]:  
B: furosemide (IV bolus) 80mg. (higher doses may be tried once)  
If there is respiratory distress (laboured breathing with low serum bicarbonate=metabolic acidosis)  
C: sodium bicarbonate (IV) 150mEq in 1L of 5%Dextrose  
Consider Proton pump inhibitors to reduce risk of gastrointestinal bleeding  
C: pantoprazole (IV/PO) 40mg 24hourly 
Treat Hyperkalaemia as in CKD  
Haemodialysis or Peritoneal dialysis when indicated 
Note  
• Indications for dialysis include pulmonary oedema, Hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis
not responding to medical therapy and uremic encephalopathy or pericarditis . Acute
poisoning with a dialysable substance is another indication.
• Patients with AKD will be followed regularly to moni tor and prevent CKD. A weekly
kidney assessment (creatinine and/or urinalysis) for one month and then monthly for 2
months and then 6 -monthly thereafter is a suggested regime when there is no CKD.
• Do not put up a drip and do not give a fluid infusion if th e patient is fluid overloaded or
urine does not increase with iv. fluids
Referral 
All cases where adequate laboratory and clinical resources exists, management according to the hospital level guidelines may be instituted. Referral to the nephrologist sh ould occur in the 
following :-  
• Glomerulonephritis is a strong possibility – haematuria and proteinuria
.
• Worsening despite initial treatment .
21.3 Glomerular Diseases (GD)  
Glomerular diseases include a broad array of cl inicopathological syndromes which progress to 
glomerulosclerosis and eventually end stage kidney disease. Glomerular disease may be a result of 
a primary condition of the kidney or may be secondary to a systemic disorder.  478	Clinical Presentation  
• Proteinur ia
• Reduced GFR (and its effects)
• Haematuria• Hypertension
• Oedema.
21.3.1 Glomerular disease - Nephritic syndrome

C: amlodipine (PO) 5mg stat before referral to higher facility  
Continue with other medications as in hypertension section (caution contraindications)  
Note  
 The definitive treatment of nephritis depends on the cause – an assumption of acut e post 
streptococcal nephritis or any other disease cannot be made without specific investigation, which 
may include kidney biopsy.  
21.3.2 Nephrotic syndrome  
It is a kidney disorder characterized by urinary protein loss leading to generalized body swellin g. It 
is severe proteinuria defined as: Adults: 3.5 g/day,  
Clinical Presentation  
• Oedema
• Hypoalbuminaemia
• Hyperlipidaemia
Note  
• Diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome requires a kidney biopsy, however in children (1year -18
years) biopsy is indicated for children with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome
• Children (1 -18 years) should be given treatment with steroid, they should be referred for
renal biopsy if there is no response.479	Non-pharmacological Treatment  
Adequate calories and adequate protein 1g/kg/d  
No ad ded salt to limit fluid overload  
Pharmacological Treatment  
The management of glomerular disease depends on the type/cause of the disease and is 
individualized guided by a specialist according to the histology results obtained after renal biopsy.  
Note  
 Referral to nephrologist may include treatment using immunosuppressant such as prednisolone, 
mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, angiotensin blockade etc

21.4 Kidney Transplantation  
Kidney transplantation is one of the kidney replace ment therapies with good outcomes in morbidity 
and mortality. A Kidney Transplant recipient (KTR) is a fully rehabilitated individual who is capable of 
contributing to the society.  
21.4.1: Transplant Donor Evaluation  
General principles of preparing a live Kidney Transplant Donor will be outline in this subsection. Risk 
assessment and communication to ensure the donor candidate is able to decide without undue pressure is one of the early steps in evaluation. The transplant program policies of concerned centr e 482	should be the basis for decision. Post decision for both accepted or excluded, follow up care should 
be formulated.  
Clinical presentation  
A complete history and physical examination should be documented . 
Investigations  
Investigations will be based on th e following :- 
Adults aged 18years and above should be considered for live related donation. Pre -donation 
evaluation should include  
• Psychosocial assessment
• Surgical assessment for suitability
o Obesity
o Anticoagulation
o Vascular anatomy and native kidneys in polycystic kidney disease
o Urology
• Diabetes screening
• Cancer screening this should proceed even after transplantation.
o Imaging, cystoscopy even colonoscopy for candidates with specific increased
risks
o Do not exclude patients with cured malignancy. Waiting t ime will depend on
malignancy
• Pulmonary disease assessment
• Cardiovascular disease assessment
o ECG and ECHO
o Stress ECG
o Dobutamine ECHO if above 40 years/ has risk of myocardial arterial disease.
• Peripheral arterial disease
o All candidates by history and phys ical examination. Imaging may be necessary .

o Human leukocyte typing for MHC and Class I, II in both donor and recepients
o Donor specific anti -HLA antibodies in recipients
• Pre-donati on Kidney function
o Serial Serum creatinine, eGFR
o Measured creatinine clearance
o OR measured GFR
o In special situations single kidney GFR (using radio labelled agents eg TC -DTPA
-technetium 99mTc -diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid  (DTPA)483	21.4.2: Transplant Candidate  
All patients with CKD stage 4 -5 should be informed of, educated about and considered for kidney 
transplantation regardless of socioeconomic status, sex, or ethnicity. Pre -emptive transplantation 
referral should be 6 -12 months before anticipated RRT initiation. Active diseases should be 
controlled first before transplantation.  
The following are not recommended for kidney alone transplant  
• Multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis
• Decompensated cirrhosis
• Severe irreversible obstructive or restrictive lun g disease
• Severe uncorrectable and symptomatic cardiac disease

o CMV
21.4.3 Transplant Recipient  
This section will cover the management of kidney transpla nt recipients (KTRs). It includes initial and 
maintenance immunosuppression, monitoring and management of special conditions. Enhanced 
investigations and treatment in this group is paramount to ensure kidney graft survival.  484	21.4.4.1 Induction Therapy  
There  is a choice of Interlukin 2 receptor blockers and lymphocyte depleting agents. Patients with 
high immunologic risk for acute graft rejection should receive lymphocyte -depleting agents instead 
of IL2 -RA. The following factors favor using lymphocyte -depleti ng agents.  
• One or more human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches
• Younger recipient and older donor age
• Panel reactive antibody (PRA) greater than 0 percent
• Presence of a donor -specific antibody (DSA)
• Blood group incompatibility
• Delayed onset of graft functi on
• Cold ischemia time greater than 24 hours
For low risk patients  
Adults  
S: basiliximab 20mg (IV) stat within 2hours before transplant and (IV) 20mg stat on day 4  
OR (high risk patients)  
S: rabbit anti -thymocyte globulin 1.5 mg/kg/day for 4 to 7 days; t he first dose prior to 
transplant (Intra OP)  
OR 
S: Antithymocyte globulin ATG (horse) 
Children  
For children above 35kg use same dose as adults. 
Below 35kg use below 
S: basiliximab (IV) 10mg stat within 2hours before transplant and 10mg IV stat on 
day 4 
OR (high risk patients)  
S: horset anti -thymocyte globulin 1.5mg/kg/day for 4 to 7days; the first dose prior 
to transplant  
21.4.4.2 Maintenance Immunosuppressive Medication  
A combination of immunosuppressive medication which include a calcineurin inhibit or (CNI) and an 
antiproliferative agent with or without corticosteroids is recommended at this stage. Except for when 
mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) is used, it is recommended to start 
immunosuppression before or during transplantation wi thout waiting for graft function establishment.  
Monthly investigations  
• Serum creatinine and Blood urea nitrogen
• Urinalysis
• Urine biochemistry (Urine dipstick)
• Serum Tacrolimus (12 -h trough) or cyclosporin (12- h trough or 2 -h post dose) levels
according to  patient’s regime
Pharmacological Treatment  
 Adults  
S: tacrolimus initial 0.1 -0.2mg/kg/day in 2divided doses titrate to planned serum levels 
(immediate release)  
OR 
If tacrolimus is not available 
Adults and Children  
S: cyclosporin (modified) 7 -12mg/kg/day in 2divided doses (titrate to serum levels)  485	In special indications (eg. with Kaposi Sarcoma) or mostly low risk KTRs  
Adults  
S: sirolimus loading dose: 15mg loading dose on day 1. Maintenance: 5mg/day (trough 
concentration 5 -7ng/mL 
AND 
S: mycophenolate m ofetil (PO) 1 -1.5g 12hourly 
OR 
S: mycophenolate sodium 360- 1080mg 12hourly  
OR 
S: azathioprine Initial following transplant IV/PO 2 -5mg/kg stat. Maintenance (PO) 1 -
3mg/kg 24hourly 
AND 
Glucocorticoids as part of triple -agent immunosuppressive regime 
Initial 
D: methylprednisolone 7mg/kg (maximum of 500mg) IV stat intra (OP) –operation 
OR 
A: prednisolone 1mg/kg/day (max 80mg) for first 3 days’  post-transplant  
Maintenance  
A: prednisolone 20mg/day 7 days then taper by 5mg weekly maintain at 5mg/kg  
After 4months post transplantation efforts to decrease dose of immunosuppression if there has been 
no acute rejection. Do not stop steroids or CNIs  
Note  
• Use of a non -dihydropyridine CCB to minimize CNI dosage may be economical.
• Assessment for medication adherence is crucial. So education for all KTRs and family
members is important.
21.4. 4. 3 Monitoring schedule for the Kidney Transplant Recipients (Routine)  
Kidney transplant recipients have high risk of getting complications including surgical complications 
(first 3 months), frequent infections (first six months) and complication related to immunosuppressive 
medications including diabetic mellitus. Some of the immunosuppressive medications have a narrow therapeutic window and have toxic effects including nephr otoxicity. Therefor these patients need 
regular and frequent follow up as indicated in the table below.

21.6 Renal artery stenosis  
Renal artery stenosis is narrowing of the one or both renal arteries. Atherosclerosis or fibromuscular 
dysplasia are the commonest causes. Progression to chronic kidney disease and end -stage disease 
may be prevented or s lowed. 
Clinical presentation  
• Hypertension, which is resistant, refractory to therapy with three or more drugs.
• Young onset hypertension with no family history
• An acute rise in serum creatinine >30% after ACE -inhibitor or ARB use

AKI is a common manifestation in the kidney due to the glomerular circulation damage and occlusion. Early recognition is important. Clinical presentation • Haemolysis • Ischemic organ dysfunction • AKI • Extrarenal manifestations include o Pancreatitis and Hepatitis o Seizures o Diarrhoea/vomiting and abdominal pain o Digital gangrene  Investigations • ADAMTS13 activity (>10% excludes TTP) • Bacterial culture/serology o HIV serology • ANA, anti-ds DNA, anti-phospholipids, anti Scl70 • Kidney biopsy  Pharmacological Treatment Identify and treat the underlying cause. Primary thrombotic microangiopathies includes complement mediated aHUS and Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with decreased ADAMTS13. S: plasma exchange (until ADAMTS13 to exclude TTP) +/- immunosuppression 21.8 Reflux nephropathy A type of chronic interstitial nephritis associated with vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR) in early life with the appearance of scars in the kidney as demonstrated by various imaging modalities. May be associated with renal dysplasia and other congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract. Including urethral valves. Clinical presentation • Usually asymptomatic • Hypertension • Frequency of micturition • Dysuria • Aching lumbar pain • Urinalysis shows leucocytes  Investigations • Ultrasonography – KUB • Radionuclide DMSA scans • Serial imaging by Magnetic Resonance Imaging – MRI • Renal biopsy 	
	490	• MCUG- micturating cystourethrography • Urine analysis – dipstick/biochemistry/microscopy • Serum creatinine • Urine culture Non-pharmacological Treatment • If recurrent pyelonephritis occurs in an abnormal kidney with minimal function – Nephrectomy • Hypertension may be cured by removal of a diseased kidney • Severe reflux may be managed by ureteric reimplantation or sub trigonal injection of Teflon/polysaccharide  Pharmacological Treatment Treat UTI as in section with Urinary tract infection.  21.9 Contrast Induced Nephropathy (CIN) Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN), which is also known as Contrast Induced Acute Kidney Injury may occur after administration of iodinated contrast material, which is called contrast-induced nephropathy. Common contrast based studies resulting in CIN include CT scan, MRI and coronary angiography. Contrast induced acute kidney injury is usually characterized by rapid recovery of renal function. Clinical features  Major clinical manifestations of CIN include  • Early mild increase in serum creatinine that is generally observed within 24-48 hours after the iodinated contrast exposure and that is usually mild. Serum creatinine starts to decline within 3-7days of exposure • Nonoliguria, patients with CIN are passing urine normally and if it occurs develop immediately. o Oliguria and more severe elevation of creatinine may develop in patients with moderate to severe CKD.  • Urinalysis may show sediments consistent with acute tubular necrosis. • Other manifestations of reduced GFR including hyperkalaemia, acidosis and hyperphosphataemia   Investigations • All patients scheduled for contrast studies should have serum creatinine performed before the study and 24-48hours after contrast study  • For patients with raised creatinine o Serial creatinine should be performed until 7 days o Potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium and urinalysis  o Kidney ureters and bladder ultrasound  Treatment and prevention of CIN  Non-pharmacologic Treatment  • Identify all at risk patients; diabetic mellitus, heart failure, patients with CKD • Stop NSAID 24-48 hours prior to contrast study  • Encourage adequate hydration prior to study  • Use lower possible dose of contrast (<125 ml)   • Use low osmolar (iohexol, ioversol) or iso-osmolar (iodixanol) contrast media  Pharmacologic Treatment • Fluid administration should be used if there are no contra-indications. Normal saline should be administered before and continued for few hours after the study o Outpatients: 3mL/kg over one-hour pre-procedure and 1-1.5mL/kg/hour during and for four to six hours’ post-procedure, with administration of at least 6mL/kg post-procedure 	
	491	o Inpatients; 1mL/kg/hour for 6-12hours pre-procedure, intra-procedure, and for 6-12hours post-procedure Note Patient with severe CIN may need to undergo haemodialysis if there is no improvement within 7days.   21.10 Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) Urinary tract infections may involve the upper or lower urinary tract. Infections may be complicated or uncomplicated. Uncomplicated cystitis is a lower UTI in a non-pregnant woman of reproductive age and who has a normal urinary tract. All other UTIs should be regarded as complicated. The commonest causative pathogens for UTIs irrespective of the group of patients involved in Tanzania are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus spp. and Staphlococcus aureus.  Note  • Differentiation of upper from lower urinary tract infection in young children is not possible on clinical grounds • Upper UTI is a more serious condition and requires longer and sometimes intravenous antimicrobial treatment.  • Special considerations should be given in the following groups of patients: children, pregnant women, elderly (>60 years) and other individuals with functional or structural abnormalities in the urinary tract.

Management of BPH depends on severity of symptoms according to International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)  Clinical Presentation • Obstructive symptoms: weak, intermittent stream and urinary hesitancy   • Irritative (frequency, nocturia and urgency) voiding symptoms.  • Digital Rectal Examination reveals a uniform enlargement of the prostate with smooth surface and firm in consistence. The median sulcus is also palpable 	
	494	• Urinary retention with a distended bladder may be present in the absence of severe symptoms, therefore it is important to palpate for an enlarged bladder during examination.  • Pelvic or transrectal USS confirms the prostate enlargement • Prostatic specific antigen levels are within normal range • Symptoms should be graded by the IPSS – international prostate symptom score into mild, moderate and severe  Non-pharmacological Treatment  • Patients with mild symptoms should be put under watchful waiting (change of lifestyle and regular follow up) o Reduce fluid intake especially in the evening, avoid caffeinated drinks • Patients with severe symptoms should undergo surgery, transurethral resection of the prostate for prostate weighing up to 75g and those weighing more than 75g should undergo open prostatectomy • For patients presenting with urinary retention, insert a urethral catheter as a temporary measure while patient is transferred to hospital  • Remove drugs that prevent urinary outflow e.g. tricyclics and neuroleptics.   Pharmacological Treatment Patients with moderate symptoms according to IPSS should be put under medical therapy unless opt for surgery. Medical treatment of BPH includes alpha-adrenergic blocker or 5 alpha- reductase inhibitor or a combination of both  Adrenergic Alpha Blockers:  D: tamsulosin (PO) 0.4mg 24hourly OR  D: alfuzosin (PO) 10mg 24hourly  5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors  D: finasteride (PO) 5mg 24hourly    OR S: dutasteride (PO) 0.5mg 24hourly Anticholinergics  S: oxybutynin (PO) 5mg 8hourly for patients with persistent urgency despite above medications  Note All patients with BPH and associated complications like recurrent UTI, Haematuria, Kidney insufficiency, hernia and urinary stones need surgery and should be referred to centres where specialized care can be offered.   21.10. 3 Prostate Cancer Usually occurs in men over 50years and is most often asymptomatic. Systemic symptoms, i.e. weight loss, bone pain, etc. occurs in 20% of patients. Obstructive voiding symptoms and urinary retention are uncommon in the early stages of the disease.  Clinical Presentation • The prostate gland is hard and may be nodular with obliterated median sulcus on digital rectal examination and/or PSA elevation • Verification of prostate cancer is by prostate core biopsy • As the axial skeleton is the most common site of metastases, patients may present with back pain or    pathological fractures. • Lymph node metastases can lead to lower limb lymphoedema. • Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) is generally elevated and may be markedly so in metastatic disease.  Note Interpretation of PSA should be interpreted careful, PSA has a low sensitivity therefore some patients may have low PSA value (<4.0ng/mL) and have prostate cancer. There false positivity where PSA is raised in the absence of prostatic cancer

Diagnostic criteria are reached when a sexual problem is recurrent/ persistent and result in personal distress.   The causes of sexual dysfunction are multifactorial and may include psychological problem (depression or anxiety), relationship conflicts, fatigue, stress, prior physical or sexual abuse, medications or physical problems that make sexual activity uncomfortable (endometriosis, genitourinary symptoms of menopause).  	
`498		Non-pharmacological Treatment Correction of contributing factor (genital lesion, systemic or hormonal factors and drugs e.g. SSRIs) Psychological therapies Use of antidepressants  21.11.2 Male sexual dysfunction It is inability to attain and maintain an erect penis with sufficient rigidity for vaginal penetration and ability to ejaculate. Organic causes include neurogenic, vasculogenic, endocrinological as well as many systemic diseases and medications.   Non Pharmacological Treatment • Education counselling  • Consider the removal of drugs that may be associated with the problem.  • A change in lifestyle or medications may resolve the problem, e.g. advise cessation of smoking and alcohol abuse.   Pharmacological Treatment  • Treat the underlying condition.  • If persist refer the patient   Note The use of medication like sildenafil may result to serious problem.      	
`499		CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO MALIGNANT DISEASE CONDITIONS  22.1 Cancer Prevention, Screening and Early Detection Cancer represents a unique public health opportunity, unlike other Non-Communicable disease, it is possible to prevent most of cancers prevails in Sub-Saharan Countries including Tanzania by intervening at both Primary and secondary levels of the natural history of the disease.  Primary prevention is mainly based on educating the public to modify their life styles to avoid risk factors for cancer as well as ensure the availability and affordability of prophylactic vaccines, the secondary prevention focus on the availability of effective screening programs that allow for reducing incidence and downstage cancer.   Early detection detects (or diagnoses) the disease at an early stage, when it has a high potential for cure (e.g. cervical or breast cancer) reduce morbidity, improve quality of life as well as increase survival due to good outcome following treatment.  Key interventions in Cancer Prevention Primary Prevention This is the most efficient and cost-effective form of cancer control it involves prevention interventions that keeps a cancerous process from developing which can be through behavior change by health counseling, education and environmental controls or through a biological mechanism, such as Vaccination.  Among the most important modifiable risk factors for cancer are: tobacco use; overweight, and obesity; harmful alcohol use; sexually transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, HIV/AIDS; air pollution, both outdoor and indoor; and occupational carcinogens.  Public health education and promotion: Public Awareness raising on risk factors for cancer and providing education on ways of avoiding as well as reducing exposure through behavior change is essential. However, this is a long term intervention and may be difficult to quantify. Community education should also focus raise awareness and knowledge on the benefits of early diagnosis, ways of detection and screening. These preventive measures should be highly promoted by also raise awareness of warning symptoms and signs of cancer and taking prompt action, by the general public as well as physicians, nurses and other health care providers, can have a great impact on the disease through early diagnosis and hence more effective management.  Vaccination Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is among the most important infections associated with cancers, which can cause most cervical and anal cancers as well as a fraction of oral cancers; hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), which can cause liver cancer; and Helicobacter pylori, which is a bacterium that can cause cancer of the stomach.   Highly effective vaccines against HBV have been available for several decades and most countries include HBV vaccination in their childhood immunization programs; vaccination is also highly effective in preventing infection with the HPV types that cause the majority of cervical cancers.   Hepatitis Vaccination is recommended to general population and the high risk group such as health care workers, and can be done at all levels. The Vaccine is given in 3 doses in 6 months. Second dose should be given after 1 month after 1st dose and 3rd dose 6 months after the first dose.  HPV vaccination is recommended to girls between the age of 9 to 14 years. HPV vaccine is given in two doses at 6 months apart.    Secondary Prevention: Early detection and Cancer Screening The main aim of cancer screening is to prevent death from cancer. Screening can also make it possible to use less severe treatment methods if the cancer is detected early enough. Cervical, breast, skin, Prostate and bowel cancer, screening can actually prevent the cancer from developing. However only cervical cancer screening is offered as part of an organized program with adequate resources for high quality.   	
`500		Breast Cancer: Screening for breast cancer includes breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and breast imaging (mammogram and/or ultrasound scanning). BSE is recommended at day 10 of the menstrual cycle. For post-menopausal women, a monthly BSE schedule should be established.   All patients with clinical suspicious lesions should have imaging as part of early detection. Mammogram is recommended for women over 40 years, while ultrasound is the imaging of choice for younger women. MRI may be used where possible for screening and early detection in patients at high risk of breast cancer such as those with BRCA1 & 2 gene mutations.  For prevention and early detection, all women aged 25 years and above should be taught on breast self–examination and should be advised to have regular physical check with a heath provider and have a regular annual Mammography. They should also be encouraged on physical excise and proper diet. Skin Cancer: Prevention or early detection is through frequent self–health check–up or screening exercise and prompt treatment of early skin lesions. For light skinned people–avoid UV light especially people with Albinism. Colon: colorectal cancers are usually asymptomatic until advanced stage hence regular screening with annual digital rectal examination, stool for occult blood + colonoscopy and are recommended starting at 50 years of age. Prostate: Routine screening not recommended, but when done should begin with PSA and digital rectal examination at age 50 if life expectancy is >10 years. It is recommended that screening of high risk group should take place starting at age 45. 22.2 Gynecological Malignancies 22.2.1 Cancer of the Uterine Cervix  It is caused by persistent infection with human papilloma Virus (HPV). Risk factors include early coitus and childbirth, multiple sexual partners, smoking and HIV infection. It is preventable through avoiding risk factors, screening and vaccination. When detected early, it is curable by surgery or radiotherapy hence regular screening is required for all women.  Diagnostic Criteria • Asymptomatic in early stages of the disease.  • Majority present with abnormal vaginal bleeding (post coital, inter-menstrual or postmenopausal vaginal bleeding).  • Foul smelling discharge, pain and incontinence (VVF or RVF) are symptoms of late disease     Investigations • FBC, LFT, RFT and HIV test.  • CXR.  • Abdomen and Pelvis USS.  • Pelvic MRI, CT Scan of the abdomen and pelvis.  • PET/CT • Bimanual Examination under Anesthesia (EUA) and Biospy.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the commonest histological type, usually arising from premalignant lesions–vulva intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). Risk factors contributing to development of VIN and later vulva cancer include HPV infection, infection with HIV, and cigarette smoking.   Diagnostic Criteria • A lump or vulva mass • Presence of leukoplakia and other dystrophic changes on the vulva  • Itching is a common manifestation and may become ulcerative (“non-healing ulcers”)  Investigations • FBC, LFT, Urea, Creatinine, HIV test • CXR • Ultrasonography or CT scan of Abdomen and Pelvis • Colposcopy to determine presence of other lesions in the vagina and cervix • Biopsy from the vulvar lesion to confirm the diagnosis • PET/CT  Staging: FIGO and TNM. Management: Treatment is individualized, taking into considerations of histological type, disease stage and patient factors  Primary treatment is surgery. Wide Local Excision (Radical Vulvectomy) plus Groin Lymphnode dissection.    Radiotherapy is indicated in the following conditions: • As primary therapy for patient with small primary tumors particularly young patients in whom surgical resection would have significant psychological consequences. • For patients with locally advanced disease where resection is not possible. 	
`503		• After surgery to treat the pelvic and groin nodes. • After surgery in patients with positive surgical margins. • In palliation (Pain, Bleeding etc)  Pharmacological Treatment: As for cervical cancer  22.2.4.    Gestational Trophoblastic Disease 22.2.4.1 Hydatidiform mole Two types; complete and partial hydatidiform mole. Treatment is suction curettage or hysterectomy. Careful risk assessment is needed to determine patients who require chemotherapy after surgery. Patient with high risk hydatidiform mole will have to reserve single agent chemotherapy; methotrexate or actinomycin D    Note: Patient should be followed up with weekly serum β–hCG after surgery until it is undetectable. 22.2.4.2 Choriocarcinoma  Choriocarcinoma is extremely chemo sensitive; cure is possible even in metastatic disease.

Due to anatomical location, most patients present with advanced disease.  Diagnostic Criteria • Minimal or no symptoms in early stage • Abdominal distension with palpable mass, pain and ascites are all late signs  Investigations: • Inspection and bimanual examination under anesthesia (EUA) recto–vagina are mandatory to exclude primary disease or extension from other sites such as cancer of the cervix • FBC, RFT, LFT, CA 125 & CEA • CXR • Abdomen and Pelvis CT Scan or USS • Histology of Oophorectomy specimen or biopsy obtained at laparotomy • Ascitic fluid/peritoneal and pelvic washing cytology  Staging: Is based on surgical diagnosis (laparotomy): FIGO: IA, IB, IC, IIA, IIB, IIC, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, IVA and IVB.  Table 22.7: Management: Surgery Stage 1 and 2 Total hysterectomy with Bilateral Salpingo –Oophorectomy (TAH+BSO) and omentectomy should be performed in resectable tumor.   If total tumor removal is not possible, then maximum debulking (Cyto –reductive) surgery is done. This is followed by adjuvant Chemotherapy. Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is only justified for stage IA tumour with favourable histology. Stage 3 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by Surgery and then Adjuvant Chemotherapy. Stage 4 As stage 3 +/- Palliative care.  Pharmacological Treatment  Adjuvant chemotherapy Indicated in all patients at high risk i.e. stage IC or II, high grade or clear cell cancers of any stage. Recommended regimens is; S: carboplatin (IV) AUC 6  1 hour infusion Day 1 AND  paclitaxel (IV) 175 mg/m2 over 3 hours day1; repeat every 21days for 6 cycles.   For recurrent disease: give same regimen if tumor is platinum sensitive (recurrence after 6 months since last chemotherapy cycle) For platinum resistant disease give gemcitabine or bevacizumab as single agent or in combination with taxanes. When available, liposomal doxorubicin is active and indicated in recurrent disease.  S: gemcitabine (IV) 1000 mg/m2  30 minutes infusion Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15;       Repeat every 4 weeks for 6 Courses  S: bevacuzimab (IV) 15 mg/kg 1-hour infusion Day1, every 3 weeks until       disease progression   Endocrine therapy is indicated in selected cases with recurrent disease.

`506		22.3 Breast Cancer The etiology of breast cancer is so far unknown, however, age, nulliparity, not breastfeeding, first pregnancy age 35years, previous radiation exposure, family history of breast cancer, smoking and alcohol consumption, are the risks associated with breast cancer.  Screening for breast cancer includes breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and breast imaging (mammogram and/or ultrasound scanning and or MRI Breast). All patients with clinical suspicious lesions should have imaging as part of early detection.   Diagnostic criteria A solitary hard lumps or mass in the breast that may be associated with • Changes of breast skin appearance or ulceration • Nipple retraction • Presence of axillary lymphadenopathy or elsewhere • Attachment/fixed to chest wall muscles  Other symptoms and signs include cough, bone pain/fracture, or neurological symptoms depending on site of metastasis  Investigations • FBC, LFT, Urea, Creatinine • ECHO Mammogram/MUGA (Baseline Ejection Fraction and follow up) •  Bilateral Mammography, Breast Ultrasound as necessary • CXR • Abdominen and Pelvic USS • Bone scan • CT scan and or PET/ CT where indicated • Open biopsy for histopathology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) • A core needle biopsy done manually, or preferably by ultrasound or stereotactic guidance is recommended. • Immuniohistochemistry (IHC) – ER, PR and Her 2 • FISH/CISH for Equivocal Her 2 for Confirmation of Her 2 OverExpression • Breast MRI may be of value in select group of women who have had equivocal mammogram/ ultrasound.   Staging: TNM Management: Includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy  Surgery Optimal management includes multidisplinary evaluation by clinical oncologist and breast surgeon.   Options for surgical management include:  • Breast conserving surgery with lumpectomy/quadrantectomy • Modified radical mastectomy • Toilet Mastectomy  As described above, all surgical approaches should include surgical axillary staging with axillary lymph node dissection to level 1 and 2 nodes (>10 lymph nodes dissected).  Surgical approaches aimed at breast conservation should only take place in cases that allow for multi-disciplinary management with access to radiotherapy. If radiotherapy access is limited, mainstay of surgical care should be modified radical mastectomy.  Radiotherapy is strongly indicated in the following conditions: • After BCS • T3–4 tumor • Positive surgical margin • If ≥ 4 sampled lymphnodes are positive • Palliation for fungating and bleeding tumor, mets to bones, brain etc.  	
`507		Radiotherapy dose: 50Gy/25 Fractions given in 5 weeks or Hypofractionation 40.05Gy/15 Fractions. For palliative intent usually 30Gy/10 Fractions in 2 weeks  Pharmacological Treatment Chemotherapy is indicated for almost all patients as neo-adjuvant, adjuvant or palliative. Patients, who are planned for surgery and have ≥ T3 tumors, should receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy before operation.

Note ● All patients must be referred to a specialized oncology center for proper management 22.4 Cancer of The Skin Skin cancers are classified into non melanoma and malignant melanoma. 22.4.1 Non-melanoma Skin Cancers Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell (SCC) are the most common non melanoma skin cancers. SCC is more aggressive than BCC and has the potential to metastasis.  The main cause of these skin cancers is overexposure to Ultraviolet radiation. Risk factors include light-coloured skin (e.g albinism), previous burn and immunosuppression eg after transplant or HIV infection   Prevention or early detection; is through frequent self–health check–up or screening exercise and prompt treatment of early skin lesions. For light skinned people–avoid UV light especially people with Albinism.  Diagnostic Criteria The most common warning sign of skin cancer is a change in the appearance on exposed areas of the skin, such as a new growth or a sore that will not heal. Occasionally, such changes may appear on an old burn area.   Investigations • None if lesion is small • Local X-ray if bone involvement is suspected • CXR  • Biopsy – preferably excisional biopsy where possible for histology • CT or MRI for suspected Nodal and bone involvement. • PET/CT when indicated  Management  Surgery is the primary treatment. Wide local excision that achieves negative surgical margins is adequate. Skin grafting may be required after surgery. Amputation sometimes is done for palliation. Locally destructive methods such as curetting or cryotherapy may be employed Radiotherapy Indication: Positive margin, high grade disease or inoperable tumour.   Dose: 60-66Gy/ in 30-33 Fractions EBRT for Radical Treatment, 30Gy in 10 Fractions for palliative treatment   Pharmacological Treatment S: 5-fluorouracil topical cream apply every after 12 -24 hours, for very superficial lesions or carcinoma in situ  Systemic chemotherapy is given for palliation in advanced stage or as radio sensitizer. 	
`509		 22.4.2 Malignant Melanoma  Diagnostic criteria History of a pre-existing naves which has changed recently –itching, colour change, increase in size, satellite lesions, elevated surface, ulceration and/or oozing.  Investigations • CXR • Abdomen and Pelvic CT Scan or USS • PET CT  • Excisional biopsy of suspicious lesion for histopathology  Staging: Clark’s or Breslow classifications are used. Tumour size closely correlates with prognosis. Detection/ prevention: Frequent self –check up or screening exercise and prompt treatment of naves  Management: Surgery is the primary treatment. • Wide local excision and graft • Amputation sometimes for advanced useless limb  Pharmacological Treatment  S: cisplatin (IV) 20mg/m2/day 30 minutes’ infusion day 1-4 AND vinblastine (IV) 1.6mg/m2/day bolus day 1-5 AND dacarbazine (IV) 800mg/m2 30minutes infusion day 1 repeat every 21 days for 6 cycles OR S: dacarbazine (IV) 250mg/m2 30 minutes’ infusion Day1–Day 5 every 21 days  for 4 cycles     OR S: temozolomide (PO) 200mg/m2 Day 1–Day 5 every 28 days  Radiotherapy used for palliation if: • Lesion is inoperable. May use large fractions: 30Gy/6Fractions/1 week • Excision margins are involved or very close • Palliative intent 30Gy in 10 Fractions/ 20Gy in 5 Fractions (brain mets, fungation or profuse bleeding, bone pain etc)  22.4.3 Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) It is a malignant tumour of angio–formative cells usually starting from the skin but occasionally involving many other organs of the body. Kaposi sarcoma can be primarily categorized into four types: epidemic of AIDS–related, immunocompromised, classic or sporadic, and endemic (African). Here we have Non AIDS related (endemic) KS and AIDS related (epidemic) KS where the late is more common 80–85%. Diagnostic criteria • KS presents as a firm, dark brown nodules or plaque in the skin. Usually more on the limbs • In young children and those with immunodeficiency it presents as wide spread lymphadenopathy with or without skin lesions.  • Presence of B symptoms (fever, sweating and weight loss) is commonly associated with epidemic type.   Investigations • FBC, LFT, Urea & Creatinine, HIV test (if positive CD4 count and viral load) • CXR • Abdomen and Pelvis ultrasound or CT scan •  Chest Scan CT • Bronchoscopy and Endoscopy • Skin biopsy for histological confirmation  Staging of KS: Epidemic Kaposi sarcoma use AIDS clinical trials group (ACTG) system and for endemic/classical Kaposi sarcoma use Mitsuyasu classification system.  	
`510		Management: • Treatment is palliative irrespective of type and stage hence careful assessment and decision is required to choose the best palliative treatment.  • ARVs should be initiated in epidemic KS patients who have not started the treatment.  • Choice of palliation depends on clinical presentation and patient general condition.  Radiotherapy: Is the best palliative treatment in symptomatic patient with local or extensive disease. • 8Gy single fraction for disease on limbs or lower half body  • 6Gy single fraction for upper half body • Dose of 9Gy/3Fractions or 22Gy/11 Fractions can be prescribed for lesions elsewhere.  Pharmacological Treatment Palliative chemotherapy is usually given in patient with generalized disease.   Recommended regimens are:  S: doxorubicin (IV) 25 mg/m2 over 30 minutes day1 AND bleomycin (IV) 10 IU/m2 over 10 minutes’ day 1 PLUS vincristine (IV) 1.4mg/m2 over 10 minutes (max.2mg) day1 given every 21 days for 6 –8 cycles  OR S: paclitaxel (IV) 100mg/m2 day 1 every 14days   OR S: docetaxel (IV) 75mg/m2 day 1 every 21days is given for persistent or recurrent after ABV.  22.5 Head and Neck Cancers Cancer of the head and neck include the following: The oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, nasal cavity, para nasal sinuses, salivary glands, and thyroid.    These tumours may present with a neck mass due to lymph node metastases, with or without findings from the primary disease site. Important etiological factors are smoking, excessive alcohol, viral infections (eg HPV and EBV), genetic predisposition, previous exposure to radiation and industrial chemicals. Squamous cell carcinoma is the commonest histological type for the malignancies but salivary gland tumors are mostly adenocarcinoma.  22.5.1 Nasopharyngeal Cancer Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is the predominant tumor type arising in the epithelium of the nasopharynx.  Diagnostic Criteria • Neck mass, unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and cranial nerve palsies  Investigations: • FBC, RFT, LFT and HIV • CXR • Abdominal ultrasound • CT scan and/or MRI of the nasopharynx, skull base, and neck • Nasopharyngoscopy • Endoscopic guided biopsy of the primary tumor for histology • PET CT • Immunohistochemistry to further confirm the diagnosis  Staging: TNM staging system  Management Due to deep location of nasopharynx, and anatomic proximity to critical structures, radical surgery is typically not used. Role of surgery is initially for biopsy for histological confirmation. It may also be used for management of the neck for persistently enlarged lymph node.  	
`511		Nasopharyngeal cancer is mainly treated by radiotherapy either alone or in combination with chemotherapy.  Table 22.9 Management of Nasopharyngeal cancer by Stage Stage Management Stage I Radiotherapy alone to primary disease and neck Stage II–IVB Concurrent chemotherapy and radiation to the primary disease and neck Stage IVC palliative care (which may include chemotherapy and radiotherapy) Induction chemotherapy can be considered for stage III–IVB If delays are anticipated in initiation of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation. Local recurrence Chemotherapy, surgery or re-irradiation  22.5.2 Laryngeal Cancer  Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common cancers of head and neck. It is predominantly found in men and mostly in those with history of tobacco smoking and alcohol intake. It is divided into three major anatomic regions; supraglottis, glottis and subglottic.  Diagnostic Criteria • Hoarseness, stridor, difficulty in breathing, neck mass, odynophagia, cough.  Investigations: • FBC, RFT and LFT • CXR • CT scan and/or MRI of the Head and Neck • Laryngoscopy • Pathology: Definitive diagnosis is confirmed by laryngoscopy-guided biopsy of the primary tumor  Staging: TNM Staging system  Table: 22.10 Management of Laryngeal Cancer by Stage Stage Management Stage I and II Primary site: Partial or Total laryngectomy OR Radiotherapy alone. Stage III–IVB Concurrent Chemoradiation or Total Laryngectomy and neck dissection followed by Adjuvant Radiotherapy or Chemo radiotherapy Stage IVC Palliative care  22.5.3 Hypopharyngeal Cancers: Hypopharyngeal cancer includes tumors arising from the pyriform sinus, posterior pharyngeal wall, postcricoid region. It is associated with tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and Plummer–Vinson syndrome.   Diagnostic Criteria: • Dysphagia, odynophagia, change in speech (dysarthria), neck mass, referred otalgia, throat pain, weight loss, sensation of mass in throat and hoarseness of voice.  Investigations • FBC, RFT and LFT • Hypopharyngoscopy and biopsy for histopathology • CXR • CT scan and/or MRI of the Head and Neck  Staging: TNM staging system.  Management  Radiation therapy is the mainstay of first-line local treatment for early stage hypopharyngeal carcinoma. For more advanced disease, concurrent chemoradiation reduces the rate of distant metastasis, and improves local control.  	
`512		22.5.4 Salivary Gland Cancer Salivary gland cancers arise from major or minor salivary glands in the head and neck region. The most common malignant salivary gland tumors are mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenocarcinoma  Presentation: Depends on primary site involved. • Mass, pain, nerve palsies, neck mass  Investigations: • FBC, LFT, and RFT • CXR • CT scan and/or MRI of Head and Neck • Biopsy of the primary tumor for histology.   Staging: TNM staging system:  Treatment: • Complete surgical resection with adjuvant radiotherapy if adverse features are present • If disease is not resectable, definitive radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy is indicated • Neck dissection is indicated for high-grade tumors or clinically positive neck disease   22.5.5 Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinus Cancer These are tumors arising from nasal cavity and the four paired paranasal sinuses (frontal, ethmoid, maxillary, and sphenoid).  Diagnostic Criteria: Nasal obstruction, epistaxis, proptosis, double vision, cheek mass, loss of sensation of the cheek and loosening or pain of the teeth  Investigations: • FBC, RFT and LFT • CXR • Abdominal Ultrasound • CT scan and/or MRI of the Para nasal sinuses and neck • Direct fibre-optic endoscopy • Endoscopic guided biopsy of the primary tumor for histopathology  Staging: TNM Staging system Treatment: • Treatment is by surgery and or radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. • Surgical resection of the primary tumor and neck dissection followed by radiotherapy can be done in early disease stages. It may also be used for management persistently enlarged lymph nodes, persistent or recurrent disease after radiotherapy.  • Stage I–IINO: Complete surgical resection followed by radiotherapy alternatively definitive radiotherapy.  • Radiotherapy can be given as an alternative definitive treatment, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy. It is used in palliative care for advanced diseases • Chemotherapy is used in induction, concurrent or adjuvant therapy.    22.5.6 Oral Cavity Cancer Oral cavity consists of the upper and lower lips, gingivobuccal sulcus, buccal mucosa, upper and lower gingiva, retromolar trigone, hard palate, floor of mouth, and anterior two–third of the tongue. Risk factors include smoking, excessive consumption of alcohol, poor oral hygiene, prolonged focal denture irritation, betel nut chewing, and syphilis.  Diagnostic Criteria: • Non-healing ulcer, speech difficulty, hypersalivation, neck mass, dysphagia and otalgia    	
`513		Investigations:  • FBC, LFT, RFT and HIV   • CXR • CT Scan and/or MRI of the Head and Neck  • Mirror and fibre-optic endoscopic examination • Biopsy for histologic confirmation  Management:   Surgery is the mainstay treatment modality for cancer of the oral cavity. Single modality treatment with surgery or radiation therapy is preferred for early-stage oral cavity cancer.   Definitive radiation with concurrent chemotherapy is the current standard for unresectable locally advanced disease. Radiotherapy can be given as palliative treatment to primary or metastatic area. Chemotherapy may also be given as palliative care in a very advanced disease.  22.5.7 Oropharyngeal Cancer Oropharynx is located between the soft palate superiorly and the hyoid bone inferiorly. The oropharynx has four walls; soft palate, tonsillar region, base of tongue, and pharyngeal wall. It is associated with tobacco use and alcohol consumption and HPV. Tonsillar and pharyngeal tongue tumors frequently are initially recognized by nodal metastases.  Clinical Presentation • Sore throat, non-healing oropharyngeal ulcers, dysphagia, referred otalgia, hoarseness (with larynx invasion), odynophagia, hot potato voice and impaired tongue movement, including protrusion.  Investigations:  • FBC, LFT, RFT and HIV   • CXR • CT Scan and/or MRI of the Head and Neck  • Mirror and fibre-optic endoscopic examination • Biopsy for histologic confirmation  Management: Oropharyngeal cancers are mainly treated by Radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy. Surgery can be used in selected cases.   Table 22.11 Recommended Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy treatment for Head and Neck tumours Curative radiotherapy Radiotherapy dose for head and neck cancers is 66–70Gy given at conventional fraction of 1.8–2Gy/fractions. Concurrent Chemotherapy S: cisplatin (IV) 40mg/m2 1hour infusion weekly during Radiotherapy                                        OR  S: cisplatin (IV) 75mg/m2 1 hour infusion day 1 repeat every 21 days during radiotherapy.

`514		Note • Head and neck tumour patients must be referred to cancer specialized centers for evaluation and definitive management. Follow up visits: 1st visit at 4–6weeks then after each 3–4 months in the 1st year, 6 monthly in the 2nd year thereafter yearly.    22.5.8 Thyroid Carcinoma Thyroid cancer is a commonest endocrine malignancy in Tanzania. It accounts approximately 0.8-1% of all malignancies seen at Ocean Road cancer institute annually. Histological types are medullary, anaplastic and well differentiated thyroid cancer.   Majority of these cases are differentiated thyroid cancer, the commonest being follicular subtype followed by papillary subtype and rare ones being Hurthle cell, follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, tall cell, columnar, solid and clear cell. Female are mostly affected, the male to female ratio being 3:1  Diagnostic Criteria • Thyroid mass (Anterior neck mass), Obstructive symptoms (Stridor, hoarseness), laryngeal nerve palsy, dysphagia • Metastatic symptoms such as weight loss, difficulty in breathing, bone pain/pathological fractures  Investigations: • Thyroid function tests (T3, T4, TSH), FBC, LFTs, Urea & Creatinine, Serum calcitonin, Serum thyroglobulin levels • Thyroid Scan • CXR • Isotope bone scan • CT Scan of the neck • Biopsy or Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of a thyroid lesion  Staging: TNM Staging system Treatment:  Surgery is the mainstay of treatment; lobectomy, total or near total thyroidectomy.

Pharmacological Treatment • Radioactive iodine I-131 sodiumor potassium iodide ablation is indicated in all patients with well differentiated thyroid cancer after surgery. • Post ablation; Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy (levothyroxine) is indicated in all patients post ablation and post-lobectomy.  Aim is to keep TSH <0.1mU/L. • Tumor recurrence or metastasis: Local reccurence should be managed surgically. Local reccurence or distant metastases not suitable for surgery that are iodine avid are treated with I-131.  • Palliative chemotherapy is indicated for patients with visceral metastatic diseases not responding to I-131. Recommended regimen is:                     S: pacliataxel (IV) 175mg/m2  3 hours infusion day 1 AND doxorubicin (IV)                        60mg/m2 bolus day1 every 3 weeks up to 6 cycles.  • Radiotherapy is indicated for Adjuvant treastment to the thyroid bed post surgery with macro/microspopic residual disease, in unresectable and local reccurence that does not take up I-131 and palliation of bone and brain metastasis. Palliative dose: 30Gy in 10 Fractions. • For anaplastic carcinoma radiation is indicated and dose recommended 50-60Gy in 20-30 Fractions. • Medullary Thyroid Tumor (MTC) is primarily managed by surgery, Radiotherapy  • Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (ATC) is aggressive disease. A Total thyroidectomy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated to resectable disease. If unresectable ATC palliative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy is indicated. The recommended chemotherapy regimen is as above in metastatic disease.  Note: All patients must be referred to a cancer specialized center for proper management. 	
`515		22.6 Gastrointestinal Malignancies 22.6.1 Esophageal Cancer Histologically there are two types; SCC and adenocarcinoma. Tobacco and alcohol abuse are major risk factors for SCC whereas obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and Barrett’s esophagus are the major risk factors for adenocarcinoma.    Diagnostic Criteria • Difficult in swallowing (dysphagia) is the commonest symptom which is associated with weight loss and poor performance status.  Investigation • FBC, LFT, Urea, Creatinine • Barium swallow and meal • Chest and Abdominal CT scan • Abdominal USS • Rigid oesophagoscopy or oesophagoduodenoscopy (OGD) and biopsy for histology  Staging: TNM Staging system Management: Surgery and radiotherapy Surgery is a major component of treatment for resectable disease. Surgery and or radiotherapy may be curative in early diseases. However, most patients present in late stages, hence the goal of treatment is to prolong survival and relieve symptoms. Radiation (alone or in combination with chemotherapy) is given as a definitive, preoperative, postoperative therapy or palliative setting.

(USE INFUSION PUMP).   Metastatic disease As Rectum 22.7 Lung Cancer Worldwide lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Approximately 85 %–90% of lung cancer cases are caused by cigarette smoking. There are 2 main types of lung cancer; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). These 2 types have different prognosis and management approach.  22.7.1 Non-small cell lung Cancer Accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases   Diagnostic Criteria • Chronic chest symptoms in a smoker • Haemoptysis • May present with superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO) syndrome • Cough in patient exposed to asbestos • Findings of chest symptoms, weight loss, poor karnofsky performance scale (KPS)  Investigations: • FBC, LFT, Urea, Creatinine • CXR PA & lateral views  • CT Scan of Thorax and Abdomen • Abdominal USS • Bronchoscopy and Biopsy for histopathology • Cytology of sputum or bronchial aspirate examination  Staging: TNM staging system Management: Surgery (pneumonectomy or lobectomy) is curative for stage I and some stage II disease.  Pharmacological Treatment: Recommended Chemotherapy regimens for adjuvant, unresectable or recurrent and metastatic disease are;   S: carboplatin (IV) AUC 1-hour infusion 6 day1 AND paclitaxel (IV) 175 mg/m2 3 hours’ infusion day 1 every 21 days for 6 cycles  Radiotherapy  With advanced radiotherapy machine and treatment technic, RT may be given for neo–adjuvant or adjuvant to surgery.  Palliative Radiotherapy is frequently used in metastatic disease to bone, spinal cord compression, brain, liver and in case of superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO), atelectasis, obstructive pneumonitis and fungating masses. Dose of 30GY/10 Fractions/2weeks gives good symptom relief. 	
`521		 22.7.2 Small cell lung cancer SCLC is characterized by early development of widespread of metastases. It is highly sensitive to initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy; however, most patients eventually die of recurrent disease.    Diagnostic criteria and investigations: As in non – small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) however brain scan and bone marrow aspirate are necessary  Staging: Limited disease versus extensive disease  Pharmacological Treatment Aim is for local control and palliation. Cure rate is low  Platinum + Etoposide are the major drugs for which the tumor is sensitive.   S: cisplatin (IV) 60 mg/m2 1-hour infusion Day 1 AND etoposide (IV) 100 mg/m2 over 30 minutes Day1–3, Every 21 days for 4 –6 cycles  OR S: carboplatin (IV) AUC 5 1-hour infusion Day 1 AND etoposide 100 mg/m2 30 minutes (IV) infusion Day1–3, every 21 days for 4–6 cycles  Other recommended chemotherapeutic drugs are irinotecan and gemcitabine  Radiotherapy: Consolidation to primary site and mediastinum: 50Gy/25Fractions/5weeeks • Prophylactic brain irradiation in complete responders • Palliative treatment for symptoms relief in respiratory, bone or CNS symptoms: 30Gy/10Fractions/2wks  22.8 Genitourinary Malignancies 22.8.1 Carcinoma of the Prostate The most common type of prostate cancer is adenocarcinoma (95 %). Tumours are stratified by T stage, Gleason score (GS), and PSA into three prognostic groups of low, intermediate and high risk.  • Low risk: T1–T2a and PSA < 10 ng/ml and GS ≤ 6 • Intermediate risk: T2b or PSA 10 – 20 ng/ml or GS 7 • High risk: T2c–T4 or PSA > 20ng/ml or GS 8–10  Patient can be offered appropriate treatment options according to stage of disease, prognostic risk group and estimated survival taking into account performance status and comorbidity.   Diagnostic Criteria • May be asymptomatic in early stages of the disease • May present incidentally following examination for benign prostatic hypertrophy or elevated serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA) • Prostatic symptoms are associated with advanced stages of the disease, which include: reduced potency, urinary frequency and nocturnal, poor stream, hesitancy and terminal dribbling • Very often patients may present with bone pain including backache or pathological fracture • Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) typically reveals a hard, irregular prostate. TURP is carried out to both confirm the diagnosis and also as part of the treatment (to relieve obstruction).  Screening for prostate cancer Routine screening not recommended, but when done should begin with PSA and digital rectal examination at age 50 if life expectancy is >10 years. It is recommended that screening of high risk group should take place starting at age 45 .  Investigations • FBC, LFT, Urea, Creatinine, Serum PSA, ALP, Testosterone • X-rays of the painful bone or spine • CXR 	
`522		• Abdomen and Pelvis USS and or CT Scan • Pelvic MRI in early-stage disease • PET/CT • Bone scan • Biopsy for histopathology  Staging: TNM staging system  Treatment: Treatment depends on disease profile (Risk stratification) and patient factors as noted above. Options include: • Watchful waiting • Active surveillance • Surgery (curative or palliative) • Radiotherapy (curative or palliative) • Hormonal therapy (chemical vs surgical castration) • Chemotherapy  Surgery Early stages (Low and Interediate risk groups) can be treated with either radical prostatectomy or radical Radiotherapy with cure intent. However, surgery may cause postoperative impotence and impaired urinary control. TURP is carried out to both confirm the diagnosis and also as part of relieving obstruction.   Radiotherapy Radical Radiotherapy for Adjuvant and definitive, EBRT up to 74 Gy/37 Fractions can be given using 3DCRT or IMRT Techniques. Palliative radiotherapy is valuable to bone metastases, massive hematuria, spinal cord compression and brain mets,   Hormonal Therapy Hormonal manipulation is by surgical or medical castration. It is carried out in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Bilateral orchydectomy is a surgical hormonal manipulation and should not be regarded curative surgery.   Pharmacological Treatment:     S: goserelin (SC) 3.6 mg every 4 weeks or 10.8mg every 12 weeks with/ without oral bicalutamide (PO) 50mg once daily  Note • Goserelin is not required after orchydectomy but patient may receive Bicalutamide. • Treatment with goserelin and bicalutamide may be given up to 2 years depending on patient condition and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels  Chemotherapy  Recommended chemotherapy regimens for hormonal refractory prostate cancer are:  S: doctetaxel (IV) 75mg/m2 2 hours’ infusion day 1 given every 21 days for 6 cycles. It is mainly reserved in hormonal refractory prostate cancer.  For Bone metastases/osteolytic/tumour induced hypercalcemia are:   S: zolendronic acid (IV) 4mg over 15min given 4 Weekly  Metastatic disease  Life long ADT ± palliative RT ± bisphosphonates for hormone refractory disease. docetaxel and prednisone for androgen independent disease can add Carboplatin if docetaxel not working to Castrate resistant prostate cancer patients.   Evaluation every 3 months (Check PSA level) Castrate resistant patients with rising PSA zoledronic acid should be given monthly. These are given together with Ca2+ and Vitamin D supplements.   	
`523		In Castrate resistant patients which did not respond to Docetaxel plus carboplatin and prednisolone, patients Abberaterone acetate with prednisolone is an option (500mg OD taken with food is highly recommended)  S: abberaterone acetate (PO) 500mg one a day (Taken with food) OR S: enzalutamide (PO) 160mg daily    22.8.2 Urinary Bladder Cancer Urinary bladder cancers are malignant tumors that commonly arise from the inner lining of the bladder or its connective tissue. Common pathologies include transition cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sarcomas and secondary deposits.   Risk factors for bladder cancer include chronic irritation (schistosomiasis, irradiation, and catheterization), chemicals (aromatic amines, aniline dyes, tobacco, analgesics) and genetic predisposition. Symptoms include blood in the urine, dysuria, Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), and low back pain.   Diagnostic Criteria • Symptoms include blood in the urine, pain with urination, and low back pain.  Investigations  • FBC, RFT, LFT, Alkaline phosphatase • Urinalysis, Urine culture and sensitivity, Urine for cytology • CXR and /or CT chest • Bone scan • Abdomimen and Pelvis USS or CT scan • PET/CT • Cystoscopy with bladder mapping & Biopsy • EUA • Bimanual examination • TURBT with random biopsies of normal appearing mucosa to exclude CIS. (If trigone involved, biopsy prostatic urethra)  Staging: TNM staging system Management  Treatment of Urinary bladder cancer depends on how deeply the tumor invades into the bladder wall.  Surgery: Several modalities that may extend from bladder preserving surgery–TURB; to radical cystectomy with urine diversion depending bladder muscle invasion. Post operation patient may receive adjuvant chemo and/or radiotherapy   Chemotherapy: chemotherapy in bladder cancer may be offered before surgery or after surgery. It may also be given concurrent with radiotherapy or as palliative in inoperative tumor.   Recommended chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced and meatasatic disease are;    S: gemcitabine (IV) 1000mg/m2 infusion over 30minutes day 1, 8 & 15 AND cisplatin (IV) 70mg/m2 infusionAND over 30mins day 2 given every 28 days for 6 cycles OR MVAC regimen S: methotrexate (IV) 30mg/m2 over 5 minutes day1, 15 & 22 AND S: vinblastine (IV) 3mg/m2 over 10 minutes day2, 15 & 22 AND S: doxorubicin (IV) 30mg/m2 over 15 minutes day2 AND S: cisplatin (IV) 70mg/m2 over 30mins day2   	
`524		Radiotherapy  Radiotherapy may be given after bladder preserving surgery or alone in small lesions with a dose up to 66Gy/33Fractions concurrent with cisplatin. It is also commonly used as palliative therapy to control bleeding and or pain locally advanced and metastatic disease. Palliative dose 30Gy/10Fractions or 20Gy/5Fractions    22.9 Haematological Malignancies 22.9.1 Lymphomas World Health Organization broadly classifies lymphomas into Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  22.9.1.1 Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma NHLs are a heterogeneous group of diseases which are mainly linked by their origin within the lymphoid system and its different cellular components. They are sub classified based on the stage of maturation (immature vs. mature) and cell of origin [B cell, T cell, or natural killer cell (NK) cell].  Diagnostic Criteria • Peripheral Lymph node enlargement (commonest site-neck) • Hepatomegally and/or splenomegally in advanced stages • B-symptoms: Unexplained weight loss, fever, drenching night sweats • Coughing, trouble breathing, or chest pain in case of Superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO)  Investigations: • CXR • Chest and abdominopelvic CT Scan • PET/CT • FBC, differential and film • Bone marrow aspirate and trephine • Immunohistochemistry (IHC) • LDH, Urea and Electrolyte, Creatinine, Albumin, Aspartate transaminase (AST), Bilirubin, Alkaline phosphatase, Serum calcium, Uric acid • Pregnancy test in females of child–bearing age • Hepatitis B and C • HIV status • Tissue Biopsy for histopathology • MUGA scan/ ECHO  Note: Lumbar puncture and CSF cytology if there is CNS involvement of in NHL associated with a high risk of CNS relapse eg.

22.10 Central Nervous System Maligancies  
22.10.1 Meningiomas  
Meningiomas are the second commonest tumor s of the brain and constitute 20% of all intracranial 
tumors. Commonest sites are cerebral convexity, parasagittal and sphenoid  
ridge.  
Clinical presentation  
• Chronic headache
• Adult onset seizures
• Loss of vision
• Focal neurological deficits
Investigations  
• FBP
• Serum electrolytes
• CT / Brain
• CT/MR angiography
• Histopathology studies
Pharmacological management  
• Seizures: Give anticonvulsants.
• Brain edema: Give Dexamethasone
Non-p harmacological management 
Surgical management 
• Intracranial meningiomas are best ma naged with total excision following the principle of
maximum safe excision (Refer to Simpson grading for intracranial meningiomas)
• Subtotal resection is associated with inferior outcome and higher regrowth rates.
Radiotherapy 
• Radiotherapy is indicated in  unresectable tumors, postoperative incomplete resection for
WHO grade 1, and all grade 2/3 tumors.
• Meticulous attention to operative notes is required, as well as to postoperative CT/MRI.
Follow up 
• Follow up CT Scan/ MRI every 6 months for 1 year, then annually.
• In older patients and small tumors managed conservatively, consider CT/MRI scan yearly.	
`530		  22.10.2 Pituitary Tumors Pituitary tumors constitute 10% of intracranial tumors. Morbidity is often due to mass effect and endocrine consequencs including hyper or hyposecretion of pituitary hormones.   Clinical presentation • Chronic headache • Loss of vision • Focal neurological deficits  Investigations • FBP, Serum electrolytes,  • Anterior pituitary hormones • CT / MRI Brain • CT/MR angiography • Visual fields assessment • Histopathology studies  Pharmacological management of functional tumors  Prolactinomas These should be treated initially with dopamine receptor agonist:  Give:  D: bromocriptine (PO) 2.5mg 8 hourly  OR  S: cabergoline (PO) 0.25mg once/twice a week (Titrate with prolactin levels checked 2 weekly, aim is to maintain PRL < 30ng/ml)  Cushing’s disease Surgical management is recommended. Consider medicines that inhibit adrenocortical function only when surgery is not possible: S: metyrapone 250mg once a day (can be escalated based on response)  Acromegaly Somatostatin analogues may be used to treat acromegaly. Give S: octreotide SR  Efficacy is measured using clinical response defined as basal GH levels < 2.5 ng/ml, glucose-suppressed levels <1.5 ng/ml and normalization of serum IGF-1 levels.  Surgical management of pituitary tumors • This is the primary treatment for most pituitary tumors, except for prolactinomas which may be managed medically. • Trans-sphenoidal approach (endoscopic or microsurgical) is preferred as it is safer and better tolerated.  • Frequently subtotal especially in large tumors or tumors invading into cavernous sinuses. Hypopituitarism occurs post-operative in about 12% of patients.  Radiotherapy  Indicated post subtotal tumor resection, recurrent tumors, persistently elevated circulating hormone levels, and inoperable patients.  Follow up MRI 3 months after surgery to assess residual tumor.  Radiotherapy is very effective for control of growth of pituitary tumors (>95%), but less effective for decreasing circulating hormone levels in functional tumors.  Common complications Diabetes Insipidus: is characterized by excessive urine output due to lack of ADH, usually immediate post-operative.  Consider  D: desmopressin (PO) 0.05mg 12 hourly daily (titrate based on response.  	
`531		SIADH is characterized by decreased urine output and hyponatremia due to excessive ADH secretion, usually immediate post-operative.  Manage hyponatremia and consider   B: furosemide (PO) 40mg  CSW: characterized by excessive urine sodium secretion and hyponatremia, usually immediate post-operative. Manage hyponatremia with Hypertonic 3% saline. Consider  D: fludrocortisone (PO) 0.05-0.1mg 12hourly daily. Follow up  • There is significant risk of pituitary hypofunction after surgery or irradiation and this risk may occur up to 15 years later – the patients should be warned of the symptoms and be tested regularly.  • Patients treated with standard radiotherapy are unlikely to show an early response and would therefore be assessed at 12 monthly intervals in terms of hormone levels and pituitary function.  22.10.3 Gliomas Gliomas constitute the most common tumors of the brain affecting all age groups, with predilection to the adult population.   22.10.3.1 Low grade Gliomas (LGGs) Clinical presentation • Seizures are common  • progressive neurologic symptoms depending on site of tumor  Imaging • CT or MRI should be done in diagnosis of Gliomas.  • MR spectroscopy • Diffusion tensor tractography (DTI)  Pharmacological management Seizures: Surgical management Long term survival approaches 100% with complete removal. After partial resection, survival rates range from 80-90% at 5 years to 70-80% at 10 years and 50-60 % at 20 years.  Repeat the scans at 6, 12, 24 months to check for growth. If this is surgically resectable then repeat surgery should be attempted.  Radiotherapy  • Dose for low grade gliomas: 1.8 Gy X 28 Fractions = 50.4 Gy (5 times per                    week). Concurrent and adjuvant use of Temozolomide is indicated if available,  S: temozolomide (PO) 75mg/m2 daily during RT and 150-200mg/m2 day 1-5                       Monthly for 6 months.  • If the hypothalamus /pituitary are in the RT field, then endocrine function should also be evaluated annually by T4 & TSH, testosterone or FSH/LH.  Follow up  • CT scan immediate postoperative to assess resection.  • MRI recommended at 3months and then annually unless other clinical indications emergency.  22.10.3.2 High Grade Gliomas (HGGs) Anaplastic Astrocytoma (AA) and Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)  Clinical presentation seizures, progressive neurologic symptoms depending on site of tumor features of mass effect, or focal signs depending on location. 	
`532		 Investigations • FBP, Serum electrolytes,  • Histopathology studies • Immunohistochemistry studies: IDH, 1p/19q codeletion, ATRX mutations.  Imaging • CT brain scan • MRI preferred investigation • MR spectroscopy • CT/MR angiography • Functional MRI (fMRI)  Pharmacological management Seizures: Treat as per guidelines  Surgical management • Complete excision of the tumor is essential for improved survival. Preoperative and intraoperative techniques to improve extent of resection in a safe manner (maximum safe resection) including brain mapping, use of intraoperative fluorescein guidance to expand resection magins and neuromonitoring techniques are advocated.  • Extent of resection is best assessed on post-op CT/MRI scans.   Radiotherapy  • Patients should be CT-planned, with contrast administration. 3mm to 5mm slices cuts from Vertex to Base of skull. Large volume PTV = should completely encompass enhancing lesion seen on pre-op T2/FLAIR scan, plus small (2cm) margin. • Dose to LARGE VOLUME = 2.00 Gy X 23 Fractions = 46.00 Gy (5 times per week). • Small volume PTV (PTV2) is based on Gd-enhanced T1 weighted image= enhancing lesion on pre-op scans +1- 2 cm margin. • Dose to SMALL VOLUME = 2.00 Gy X 7 Fractions = 14.00 Gy • Total dose 60Gy in 30 fractions. • Other alternative radiotherapy fractionations can be used in elderly, more                     than 65 years of age are Hypo fractionation; 40Gy/ 15 Fractions and 5Gy X 5                      Fractions  Note • Imaging techniques such as MR Spectroscopy may be indicated during follow up to distinguish tumor recurrence from post RT changes.  Chemotherapy Concurrent chemotherapy + RT:  S: temozolomide (PO) 75 mg/m2 daily during RT, Then 150-200mg/m2 given D1-D5 of a 28 day cycle for 6 cycles after RT Oral steroid/ Ondansetron should be taken half an hour prior to chemotherapy tablet on each day. Tablets must be taken 1st thing in the morning on an empty stomach. Prophylaxis for PCP pneumonia with co-trimoxazole (one tablet twice daily) should be given during daily temozolomide treatment.  Recurrent disease • Surgery plays an important role in selected patients- relieves symptoms, improves PS and QOL and reduces steroid requirement. • Repeat radiotherapy can be considered, depending on size of lesion and previous dose. • Palliation Chemotherapy may be only modality available- active regimens are BCNU, PCV, Temozolomide and more recently, Irinotecan and Bevacizumab.  Follow up  • A baseline scan should be done at 4 months’ post RT as a reference.  • Thereafter scans are usually done at 6 months and annually, or if clinically indicated.  • High index of suspicion and testing if indicated for pituitary function. 	
`533		22.11 Oncological Emergencies Important oncological emergencies include Hypercalcemia, Superior venous cava obstruction, Spinal cord compression and Neutropenic sepsis.  22.11.1 Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVCS) Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is the clinical expression for obstruction of blood flow through the SVC. Malignancy (90%) is the most frequent cause of SVC obstruction. SVC obstruction is a strong predictor of poor prognosis in patients with non–small cell lung cancer. SVC obstruction in cancer patients can result from  • Extrinsic compression of SVC o Lung Cancer (65%) o Lymphomas (15%) o Other cancers (10%) • Intrinsic compression  Diagnostic Criteria Common symptoms and physical findings of SVCS are: • Dyspnea  • Headache  • Oedema and change in colour in the areas drained by SVC (examples–face and upper limb)  • Venous distension of neck, upper chest and arms  • Cough • Pemberton’s sign (development of facial flushing, distended neck and head superficial veins, inspiratory stridor and elevation of the jugular venous pressure (JVP) upon raising both of the patient's arms above his/her head simultaneously, as high as possible (Pemberton's maneuver)  Investigations: • CXR • CT scan Chest Abdomen and Pelvis • PET/CT • Tissue diagnosis for appropriate treatment modality • Bronchoscopy • Needle aspiration of a peripheral lymph node, or mediastinoscopy • Sputum cytology • Thoracentesis.  Non-pharmacological treatment: Treatment of SVC syndrome is divided into supportive and definitive therapy Supportive measures • Head elevation–To decrease the hydrostatic pressure and thereby the edema. There are no data documenting the effectiveness of this manoeuvre, but it is simple and without risk. • Glucocorticoid therapy (dexamethasone, 4 mg every 6 hours) to relieve inflammation and oedema (to be avoided before biopsy if lymphoma is suspected as steroid induced tissue necrosis might obscure the diagnosis) • Loop diuretics (furosemide) are also commonly used, but it is unclear whether venous pressure distal to the obstruction is affected by small changes in right atrial pressure.  Definitive Therapy • Radiation treatment to the malignant mass. • Chemotherapy–in chemo sensitive cancers like lymphoma, germ cell tumours or small cell lung cancer • SVC Stent–can be useful in cases of thrombosis and for patients not responding to cancer treatment • Removal of central venous device.  Note • It is advisable to avoid placement of intravenous lines in the arms so that fluid is not injected into the already compressed SVC. 	
`534		 22.11.2 Hypercalcaemia Hypercalcaemia refers to elevated calcium level in blood (normal range 2.2–2.6 mmol/L) that occurs in 10–20% patients with advanced cancers (most commonly in cancer of the breast, kidney, lung, prostate, head and neck and multiple myeloma)  Diagnostic Criteria • Symptoms of hypercalcaemia include nausea, vomiting, constipation, polyuria and disorientation • Psychiatric overtones (depression 30–40%, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, insomnia, coma) • Clinical evidence of volume contraction secondary to progressive dehydration may be apparent. Severe hypercalcaemia (above 3.75–4.0 mmol/L) is a medical emergency and a poor prognostic sign  Investigations include  • Specific biochemistry like PTH,  • ECG to detect arrhythmias and  • Imaging with Bone Scan or PET–CT scan to identify metastatic bone disease.  Pharmacological Treatment Treat the hypercalcaemia first and the cause later: • Hydration & dieresis: 1–2 litres of isotonic saline (NS) over 2 hours with 30–40 mg of furosemide expands intravascular volume and enhances calcium excretion.  o In elderly and cardiac patients, rate of hydration needs to be slower. • Bisphosphonates–via a complex mechanism inhibit osteoclast and in turn both normal and pathological bone resorption. Commonly used bisphosphonates are: S: zolendronic acid (IV) infused as 4mg (IV)   in 100 mls of NS over 15 mins. Normalisation of serum calcium occurs in 4–10 days and lasts 4–6 weeks. Therefore, if re–treatment is required, dose is repeated after 7 days OR S: ibandronate (IV)  6 mg  over 2 hours  infusion   Note • Bisphosphonates and denosumab cause increasing risk of osteonecrosis of jaw following extraction of teeth or oral surgical procedures. Therefore, a dental review may be necessary to make sure the necessary dental procedures are completed prior to commencing therapy • Calcitonin – a thyroid hormone given 4–8 IU/kg IM or SC every 6–8 hours can bring about a rapid decline in calcium levels, however tachyphylaxis limits its utility.   22.11.3 Spinal–cord Compression Spinal cord compression threatens mobility, independence and longevity in patients with metastatic cancer and may be the first presentation of curable malignancy in others. It most commonly occurs due to an enlarging vertebral metastasis encroaching on the epidural space or due to pathologic fracture of a vertebra infiltrated by malignancy.   Management • Immobilising the patient and obtaining urgent MRI/CT whole spine should be priorities.  • Corticosteroids should be initiated on suspicion of cord compression.   B: dexamethasone (IV) 16 mg immediately followed by 16 mg daily in divided doses.  • Bladder catheterisation is appropriate.  • Once spinal cord compression is confirmed, urgent neurosurgical opinion should be sought. There are potential improvements in outcomes for patients treated with surgery upfront, though appropriateness for this will depend upon spinal stability, patient and malignancy related factors. • Radiotherapy: for patients who are not candidates for upfront surgery.  • Palliative dose: 8Gy Single fraction or 20Gy/5Fractions or 30Gy/10 Fractions.  	
`535		Note • All patients suspicious for spinal cord compression should be referred to neurosurgeon and radiation oncologist as soon as possible.  22.11.4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome The syndrome is mostly observed in cancers with a rapid proliferation index such as Burkitt’s lymphoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia, and less frequently, solid tumors of small-cell type, breast cancer, and medulloblastoma.  Clinical Presentation Clinically, the syndrome is characterized metabolically by the presence of hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia and acute renal failure. • Work Up • FBP, RFT, LFT, LDH • Serum electrolytes phosphates and calcium  • Urine pH and output • ECG.  • CXR • CT-Scan.  • Abdomen and Pelvis USS  Treatment  • Frequent monitoring of electrolytes such as blood-urea-nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, uric acid, potassium, sodium, phosphate, calcium levels and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at least three times per day •  Also Alkalization of urine by Sodium bicarbonate added to IV fluids at 100 mEq/L this should continue for 48-72 hours after start of chemotherapy. • Hydration in high risk patients must start 12-48 hours’ prior the start of chemotherapy and continue 48- 72 hours post chemotherapy; continuous infusion should exceed 3 L/m² daily, resulting in urine volumes of at least 3L/Day.  • IV Allopurinol 300 mg/day daily   • Patients with high potassium levels must be evaluated and monitored constantly for cardiac rhythm disorders, do administer calcium and exchange resins, those with continuously low levels calcium a calcitriol must be given. •  Empiric antibiotics can be administered for opportunistic infections, consider also perenteral nutrition (TPN) and GCF (neupogen) if indicated. 20.11.5 Febrile Neutropenia Appllied only to the management of patients with:  • Fever and neutropenia as a result of a known or suspected malignancy or the use of chemotherapy • Fever and neutropenia as a result of a bone marrow failure syndrome. • Fever (or evidence of infection) who are receiving chemotherapy or who have completed cancer therapy within 6 months even though they are not neutropenic.  Work up  • FBP, LFT, RFT  • Malaria screen  • Urine analysis Urine / blood / stool culture Serum Electrolytes Throat Swab   Treatment  • Antibiotic administration  • Anti pyretics and analgesics 	
`536		Initial (first-line) and subsequent (second-line – deteriorating patients) empiric antibiotic selection. Patients with no significant betalactam reactions: D: piperacillin+tazobactam (FDC) (IV) 4 g piperacillin / 0.5 g tazobactam given every IV 6 hourly PLUS Gentamicin 3-6mg/kg once daily. Deteriorating patients on first line treatment with no history of anaphylaxis to Beta Lactams (i.e. if history of rash only, can still use meropenem OR D: meropenem (IV) 500mg 8 hourly AND amikacin (IV) 15mg/kg/dose in 2-3 devided dose (or ciprofloxacin 200– 400 mg IV 12 hourly) AND vancomycin 15 - 20mg/kg/dose 8 - 12 hourly Patients with history of definite anaphylaxis to Beta Lactams  D: ciprofloxacin (IV) as above AND metronidazole (IV) 500mg – 750mg dose 8 hourly AND amikacin dose as above AND vancomycin dose as above Culture Negative Patients  First 48 hours • Patient had a single spike of fever (i.e. patient’s temperature returns to normal within 4 hours of the initial fever), antibiotics may be discontinued.  • Patient had more than a single spike of fever, antibiotics must be continued for a minimum of 7 afebrile days. Also consider the following. • If patient develops oral herpes or severe mucositis, commence IV Aciclovir.  • Obvious fungal infection – suspect candida – add fluconazole IV; suspect other fungal infection – add Amphoteracin B IV. • Diarrhoea and vomiting – culture stool and commence ciprofloxacin and metronidazole  • Signs of skin infection – add vancomycin  • No clinical focus but deteriorating rapidly or extremely unwell – consider adding vancomycin  If by day 5-7 patient remains febrile, neutropenic, consider performing a fungal work-up, prior to commencing empiric appropriate antifungal treatment.      	
`537		CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS 23.1. Patients with Aggressive and Disruptive Behaviours These are agitated and acutely disturbed patients, who may or may not have a mental disorder. Many acute medical conditions, trauma, toxicological conditions and substance related disorders (especially substance induced disorders) can also present with agitation.  Clinical Presentation • Agitation • Aggressive behaviours  Non-Pharmacological Treatment • Ensure the safety of the patient and those caring for them. • Caution is needed with elderly and frail patients as they are vulnerable to falls and further injury if sedated. • The use of physical restraint should only be employed when there is a need to protect the patient and surrounding people in an acute setting and it should be for as short time as possible with a constant monitoring of patients’ safety  • Assess for sign of delirium.  De-escalation Techniques should be attempted first: • Calm the patient • Manage in a safe environment • Ensure the safety of all staff members  Pharmacological Treatments For cooperative patients A: promethazine (PO) 25-50mg stat   OR C: diazepam (PO)10 mg stat    OR  C: lorazepam PO)4 mg stat   Uncooperative and severely agitated patients If oral treatment fails after 30–60 minutes, OR If there is significant risk to the patient and others, give Parenteral treatment as follows:  B: haloperidol (IM) 2.5-5mg stat, repeat in 30-60minutes, if required. (Maximum dose: 20mg, within 24hours)  AND A: diazepam (IV/IM) 10mg stat. Repeat after 30–60minutes if needed. (maximum dose: 60mg per 24hours) OR A: promethazine (deep IM) 25–50mg Repeat after 30–60minutes if needed   OR C: lorazepam (IM) 1-4mg stat. Repeat after 30–60minutes if needed to a maximum dose of 12mg in 24hours    OR  D: midazolam (IV/IM) 2-10mg stat                                       If haloperidol is unavailable,  A: chlorpromazine (deep IM) 25–50mg may be repeated as necessary 4 times in 24hours (Maximum dose: 2000mg per 24hours).   If patient is known to suffer from schizophrenia and is not neuroleptic naïve give: S: zuclopenthixol acetate IM) 50–150 mg (Repeat after 2–3 days, if necessary.Give a maximum of 3 repeat injections and should not be used for longer than 2 weeks. The maximum administered dose should not exceed 400mg. If patient develops acute dystonia give: 	
`538		A: promethazine (deep IM) 25–50 mg. In the elderly 25 mg. OR A: atropine (IM) 0.5 -2 mg when required   Note • Repeated doses of high potency antipsychotics may lead to the development of the life-threatening neuroleptic malignant syndrome. If suspected, stop antipsychotic, and institute supportive care. • Elderly patients are at increased risk of respiratory depression and delirium from benzodiazepines, so they should be avoided as far as possible. • Always monitor vital signs of sedated patients   23.2. Delirium Delirium or acute confusion state is a condition characterized by altered level of consciousness, disorientation to time, place and sometimes to person.   Clinical presentation • Reduced awareness of the environment o Inability to stay focused on a topic or to switch topics o Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions or conversation o Being easily distracted by unimportant things o Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to the environment • Poor thinking skills (cognitive impairment) o Poor memory, particularly of recent events o Disorientation — for example, not knowing where you are or who you are o Difficulty speaking or recalling words o Rambling or nonsense speech o Trouble understanding speech o Difficulty reading or writing • Behavioral changes o Seeing things that don't exist (hallucinations) o Restlessness, agitation or combative behavior o Calling out, moaning or making other sounds o Being quiet and withdrawn — especially in older adults o Slowed movement or lethargy o Disturbed sleep habits o Reversal of night-day sleep-wake cycle • Emotional disturbances o Anxiety, fear or paranoia o Depression o Irritability or anger o A sense of feeling elated (euphoria) o Apathy o Rapid and unpredictable mood shifts o Personality changes  Non-Pharmacological Treatment • Control the acute disturbance.  • Perform proper physical assessment as well as investigations in order to rule out or ascertain the underlying medical condition and treat accordingly  Pharmacological Treatment Treat the underlying medical condition, if present. And any other presentations, symptomatically  Acute Management B: haloperidol (IM) 5mg stat repeated in 30-60 minutes when required (Maximum dose: 20mg within 24 hours)  	
`539		• Monitor vital signs and beware of acute dystonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome • Dosing may vary according to clinical circumstances  AND/OR A: diazepam (IV) 10mg.  OR C: lorazepam (IM) 1-4mg. Switch to oral route once containment is achieved.  Note • Benzodiazepines, especially diazepam IV, can cause respiratory depression. Monitor patients closely • In the frail and elderly patient or where respiratory depression is a concern, reduce the dose by half • The safest route of administration is oral followed by IM with the IV route having the highest risk of respiratory depression and arrest. Use the safest route wherever possible.  • Monitor vital signs closely during and after administration • Use haloperidol instead of benzodiazepines in patients with respiratory insufficiency • To avoid benzodiazepines toxicity, allow at least 15-30 minutes before repeating the IM dose  23. 3. Dementia It is a condition which involves progressive and cognitive deficits. Dementia usually affects memory first, with subsequent progression to cause dysphasia, agnosia, apraxia, diminished ability with executive function and eventually personality disintegration.  DSM-5 diagnostic criteria To diagnose Dementia, the following criteria need to be met: • There must be significant cognitive decline from a previous level of performance in one or more of the following cognitive domains - attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual motor and social cognition. • These deficits affect independence in performing everyday activities.   Non-pharmacological Treatment • Psychoeducation about the disorder, to the patient and family • Mini Mental Status Examination, functional and behavioural assessment should be performed every 6 months.  Pharmacological Treatment  Mild to moderate: S: donepezil (PO) 5mg initially, may increase to 10mg/24hours after 4-6weeks  Moderate to severe:  S: donepezil (PO) 5mg initially, may increase to 10mg /24hours after 4-6weeks; may further increase to 23 mg/day after 3 months  23.4. Schizophrenia It is a chronic mental disorder, characterized by disturbances in thought, emotions, drive, behaviour and withdrawal from reality. Symptoms vary from patient to patient and from time to time.   DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria To diagnose Schizophrenia, the following criteria need to be met; • Presence of 2 or more of the following symptoms over a 1-month period: a. Delusions b. Hallucinations c. Disorganized speech d. Disorganized behavior e. Negative symptoms (at least 1 of which must be a, b or c) • Individual’s premorbid level of functioning is affected in several major domains of life. 	
`540		• There must be continuous impairment over a period of at least 6 months, during which the individual might experience either active or residual symptoms. • These symptoms must not be due to the effects of substance usage or an underlying medical condition  Non-Pharmacological Treatment • Family counselling and psycho-education • Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for stabilized patients • Supportive group therapy for patients with schizophrenia • Rehabilitation may be enhanced by assertive community programs, work assessment, occupational therapy and bridging programs prior return to the community  Pharmacological Treatment In acute attacks: Treat like under section: patients with aggressive and disruptive behaviours.  For maintenance: B: haloperidol (PO) 3-4.5mg 12hourly, OR A: chlorpromazine (PO) 100–600mg 24hourly in divided doses  OR S: olanzapine (PO) 5–10mg titrate to maximum dose 20mg/24hours  OR S: risperidone (PO) 1mg 12hourly then increase by 1mg every 2–3 days to 2–3mg 12 hourly. Maximum dose 16mg/day   Note: • Titrate to maximum dose while monitoring dose-response to target symptoms against adverse effect • The above medicines should not be given in combination • The atypical antipsychotics have been shown to be comparatively more effective in treatment of negative symptoms  For patients who have poor compliance to oral medications and patient preference, give depot antipsychotics C: fluphenazine decanoate (IM) 6.25-50mg 2-4weekly, and monitor dose-response to target symptomsagainst adverse effect, if necessary, dose may be tapered OR S: zuclopenthixol decanoate (IM) 100-600mg 2-4weekly, and monitor dose-response to target symptomsagainst adverse effect, if necessary, dose may be tapered  OR S: flupenthixol decanoate (IM) 20–40 mg every 4weeks, and monitor dose-response to target symptomsagainst adverse effect, if necessary, dose may be tapered  Note • . Give a test dose first.  This is in view of the fact that depots are known to be long acting • Giving a test dose helps to determine whether the patient is sensitive to the medication (either via development of EPSE or any adverse reactions to the oil base) • Commence treatment with the lowest therapeutic dose • Administer the depot at the longest possible duration • adjustment of dosages should be conducted after an adequate period of assessment  Adjunct Treatment Antiparkinsonian medicines should only be used if extrapyramidal side effects(except tardive dyskinesia) occur, or at higher doses of antipsychotics likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects. Any of the following can be used:   A: promethazine (PO) 25-50mg 24hourly, until symptoms/signs subside   OR A: benzhexol (PO) 5mg 24hourly to12hourly, last dose before 1400 hourstoavoidinsomnia

Bipolar Mood Disorders These are lifelong mental disorders, which may have an episodic, variable courses. The presenting episodes may be manic, hypo manic, depressive or mixed. By definition, a diagnosis of bipolar disorders requires either a current or previous episode of mania or hypomania.   Bipolar I Disorder Diagnostic Criteria DSM-5 specified that an individual need to have at least 1 manic episode in order to fulfill the diagnostic criteria of Bipolar I disorder.  Manic Episode A manic episode is characterized by a period of time, of at least 1 week, during which the individual has persistent elevated (extreme happiness) or irritable mood and present for most of the days.

Psychiatric Disorders Associated with Epilepsy Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the biologic, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. This association may reflect the anatomical and neurobiological source of both epileptic seizures and the behavioral manifestations.  Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can play a role in the genesis of psychiatric symptoms; on the other hand, some psychotropic medications can lower the seizure threshold and provoke epileptic seizures.  The following are common psychiatric disorders in patients with epilepsy; • Major depressive disorder • Bipolar mood disorder • Anxiety disorder • Psychoses • Suicidality  Treatment of Psychotic Disorders in patients with epilepsy;  Non-pharmacological Treatment  • Psychoeducation to the patient and the family • Family therapy • Supportive group therapy • Occupational therapy  Pharmacological Treatment  A: carbamazepine (PO) 200-1000mg, in divided doses, per day (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly) OR A: phenobarbitone (PO) 30-200mg, in divided doses, per day (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly) OR 	
`553		C: sodium valproate (PO) 500-2000mg in divided doses, per day (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly)  If psychosis persists, give  B: haloperidol (PO) 0.75-4.5mg 12hourly. Maximum dose 20mg/day   OR S: olanzapine (PO) 5-10mg in divided doses, per day. Maximum dose 20mg/day (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly)   OR S: risperidone (PO) 0.5mg 12hourly then increase by 1mg every 2-3days to 2-3mg 12hourly. Maximum dose 16mg/day    Note • Postictal psychosis remits spontaneously even without treatment but that the use of effective neuroleptics may shorten the duration.  • Interictal psychosis is treated with antipsychotic drugs. Medications that lower the seizure threshold should be avoided.  • Atypical antipsychotic medications may have better profiles than typical antipsychotic medications. • Medications that lower the seizure threshold should be avoided. • The doses should be as minimal as possible  Treatment of Depressive symptoms/signs in patients with epilepsy;  Non-pharmacological Treatment • Psychoeducation to the patient and the family • Family therapy • Supportive group therapy • Occupational therapy   Pharmacological treatment A: carbamazepine (PO) 200-1000mg, in divided doses, per day (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly)   OR A: phenobarbitone (PO) 30-200mg, in divided doses, per day (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly)   OR C: sodium valproate (PO) 500-2000mg in divided doses, per day (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly)    AND A: amitriptyline 12.5-75mg (PO), nocte (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly)  OR S: fluoxetine 1 (PO) 0-20mg in divided doses, per day (symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly)  Note • In the treatment of epilepsy-related depression, priority should be given to optimizing seizure control, since improved psychosocial functioning tends to accompany seizure remission • Some anticonvulsant therapies, including sodium valproate, gabapentin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, also have antidepressant effects and may prove effective in treating depression in patients with epilepsy.  Phenobarbital is known to produce depression.    	
554		  Treatment of Mania/hypomania in patients with epilepsy; Non-Pharmacological Treatment  • Psychoeducation to the patient and the family • Family therapy • Supportive group therapy • Occupational therapy  Pharmacological Treatment A: carbamazepine (PO) 200-1000mg, in divided doses, per day  OR A: phenobarbitone (PO) 30-200mg, in divided doses, per day  OR A: sodium valproate (PO) 500-2000mg in divided doses, per day   Note Symptoms should be monitored and medication titrated accordingly  23.17. Psychiatric Disorders in Pregnancy In some women, pregnancy and motherhood increase their vulnerability to psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders,panic disorder, bipolar illness, and psychoses. These conditions are often underdiagnosed because they are attributed to pregnancy-related changes in maternal temperament or physiology. In addition, such conditions are often undertreated because of concerns about potential harmful effects of medication.  23.17.1 Depression Several risk factors and psychosocial correlates have been identified as contributing to depression during pregnancy, like; • Previous history of depression, discontinuation of medication(s) by a woman who has a history of depression, a previous history of postpartum depression, and a family history of depression  Several key psychosocial correlates may also contribute to depression during pregnancy: a negative attitude toward the pregnancy, a lack of social support, maternal stress associated with negative life events, and a partner or family member who is unhappy about the pregnancy. The relationship between maternal depression and early childhood problems may be part of a sequence that starts with depressive symptoms during pregnancy.  Non-pharmacological Treatment • Psychotherapies  o Cognitive behavioral therapy o Interpersonal psychotherapy o Education and support are also important, particularly as pregnancy is a unique experience for women, some of whom may not know what to expect.   Pharmacological Treatment  A: amitriptyline (PO) 12.5–75 mg 24hourly at night, increase gradually to a maximum of 150 mg daily. {Elderly: Initially 12.5–50 mg. Max. 75mg)   OR  D: citalopram 10-60mg (PO) 24hourly morning or evening and symptoms should be monitored, and medication to be tapered OR S: fluoxetine 20-60mg (PO) 24hourly (morning)   Note • Full disclosure of both the risk and benefits of various antidepressant medications should be made to the patient and, if possible, her partner prior to starting any pharmacological treatment. • Low doses of antidepressants should be considered when initiating medication.  	
555		12.17.2 Panic Disorder Some women may experience first-onset panic disorder during pregnancy. Women presenting with panic attacks for the first time should be screened for thyroid disorder. The correlation between plasma levels of cortisol in the mother and in the fetus may have implications for the developing fetal brain.  Non-pharmacological Treatment • Cognitive behavioral therapy • Supportive psychotherapy • Relaxation techniques • Sleep hygiene • Dietary counseling  Pharmacological Treatment Refer panic disorders  Note • Full disclosure of both the risk and benefits of various antidepressant medications should be made to the patient and, if possible, her partner prior to starting any pharmacological treatment. • Low doses of antidepressants should be considered when initiating medication  12.17.3 Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by thoughts that cannot be controlled (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or rituals that cannot be controlled (compulsions) in response to these thoughts.   Non-pharmacological Treatment • Cognitive behavioral therapy • Supportive psychotherapy • Relaxation techniques • Sleep hygiene • Dietary counseling  Pharmacological Treatment Refer to the specific section above  Note Treatments for GAD in pregnancy are the same as those in non-pregnant adults.  12.17.4 Bipolar Mood Disorder Non-pharmacological Treatment • Cognitive behavioral therapy • Supportive psychotherapy • Relaxation techniques • Sleep hygiene • Dietary counseling  Pharmacological Treatment Refer to the specific section above Note • Decision whether to use mood stabilizers must be made following an assessment of risks and benefits. • Low doses of mood stabilizers should be as low as possible • Factors to consider include number and severity of previous episodes, level of insight, family supports, and the wishes of the woman • Careful monitoring of psychological symptoms throughout the pregnancy is of paramount importance  	
556		 12.17.5 Schizophrenia Non-pharmacological Treatment • Cognitive behavioral therapy • Supportive psychotherapy • Relaxation techniques • Sleep hygiene • Dietary counseling  Pharmacological Treatment Treat as in the treatment of schizophrenia in non-pregnant woman  Note • Women with a history of psychosis require close monitoring during pregnancy • Psychosis during pregnancy can have devastating consequences for both the mother and her fetus, including failure to obtain proper prenatal care, negative pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight and prematurity, and neonaticide or suicide • Treatment of acute psychosis in pregnancy is mandatory and includes mobilization of supports, pharmacotherapy, and hospitalization • Electroconvulsive therapy may be used for psychotic depression  23.18. Autism Spectrum Disorder DSM-5 Diagnostic criteria  It states that an individual diagnosed with Autism spectrum disorder would have marked difficulties in terms of communication and engagement with others across multiple social situations. These difficulties include: • Difficulties with demonstrating appropriate behaviours in social contexts  • Difficulties associated with non-verbal communications used for social interactions  • Difficulties associated with failure to initiate or adapt to social interactions  In addition, the DSM-5 also requires the individuals to have characteristic repetitive behavioural patterns, such as • Repeated stereotypical movements or  • Highly ritualized behavioural patterns. DSM-5 criteria specified that these behaviours must have started since the early developmental period and has resulted in marked impairments in terms of functioning.   Non-pharmacological Treatment For children • Every pre-school child diagnosed with autism should have an individualised intervention plan that sets out the goals, type(s), frequency and intensity of intervention, in order to address particular developmental and educational needs • An individualised intervention plan should consist of a variety of quality programs and activities. This includes attendance in comprehensive early intervention programmes, programmes targeting specific needs and also positive engagement with parents and/or caregivers • Alternative-augmentative communication systems may be recommended for pre-school children with autism because the expanded (spoken or written) communication may stimulate speech acquisition in non-verbal children and enhance expression in verbal children. •  Visual strategies are useful interventions for children with autism because they offer visual support to communication, increase spontaneous imitation and socially communicative behaviour. • Social skills programmes depend on the functioning level of the preschool child with autism and may include: o Assessment and teaching of social skills interaction in natural settings. o Provision of structure, visual cues and predictability. o Making abstract concepts more “concrete”. o Activities that enable purposeful and appropriate interaction with typically developing peers. o Goals focusing on fostering self-appreciation and self-esteem.  	
557		For the parents • Parents and caregivers should be encouraged to discuss the need for practical emotional support. This enables  information to be provided, referrals made and support services made available • Parents and caregivers are recommended to consult appropriate professionals when considering educational placement for their child with autism  Pharmacological Treatment A: haloperidol (PO)1.5-3mg 24hourly (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution) OR A: methylphenidate (PO) 18- 54 mg 24hourly(medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution  23.19. Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) DSM-5 Diagnostic criteria  It states that an individual diagnosed with attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder would have difficulties in terms of functioning, mainly due to (a) inattention and/or (b) hyperactivity and impulsivity.  The DSM-5 states that these inattentive and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms must be present before the age of 12 years old. In addition, these symptoms must have resulted in impaired functioning in at least 2 different social situations. The DSM-5 requires the individual to fulfill at least 6 of the following signs and symptoms of inattention:  •  Failing to pay close attention to details  •  Concentration difficulties  •  Difficulties with sustaining attention at tasks  • Daydreaming and does not seem to be able to follow normal conversations  • Difficulties with organization of tasks  • Reluctance to participate in tasks that involve much attention  • Frequently loses important objects  • Easily distractible  • Forgetfulness about daily activities.   The DSM-5 also specified that only 5 of the above signs and symptoms of inattention need to be fulfilled if individuals are 17 years of age and above.  DSM-5 also requires the individual to fulfil at least 6 of the following signs and symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity:  • Moving about and unable to sit still  • Leaves seat even when required to remain seated  • Climbs or runs about in inappropriate situations  • Always having excessive energy and always on the move • Chats excessively  • Impulsive and gives answers even before being asked to  • Having difficulties waiting for his/her turn  • Unable to carry out normal conversation due to frequent interruptions  Non-pharmacological Treatment a) Parent-training/ education programmes Refer parents to educational programmes to learn about ADHD, its management and coping strategy. • For parents, the programme should include individual or group-based parent-training/education programmes. • For children and youth with ADHD, the programme should include CBT or social skill training. • Offer training to the teachers on behavioural interventions in the classroom to help the child to cope with ADHD  b) Behaviour therapy • Positive reinforcement of positive behaviour including reward system and praises. The parents can consider using 	
558		a star chart to promote positive behaviour at home. • Environmental modifications aim at improving attention e.g. placing the child in the front row of class, minimising distractions etc. • Combination of behaviour therapy and medication is better than medication alone.  23.20. Enuresis DSM-5 Diagnostic criteria  • Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes (whether involuntary or intentional) • Behavior must be clinically significant as manifested by either a frequency of twice a week for at least three consecutive months or the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning. • Chronological age is at least 5 years of age (or equivalent developmental level). • The behavior is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effect of a substance (such as a diuretic) or a general medical condition (such as diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder, etc.).  Non-pharmacological Treatment • Fluid restriction at night especially 1 hour before the desmopressin dose until the next morning, or at least 8 hours after the dose. If child wakes up during the night, limit the amount that he or she drinks. • Star chart: effective in one-third of cases • Alarm: Child must wake up and urinate.   Pharmacological Treatment A: amitriptyline (PO) 25mg nocte (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution)   OR C: imipramine (PO) 100mg nocte (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution)  23.21. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Mostly is caused by the use of high dose of antipsychotics; potent antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol) and antipsychotics that are given via the intravenous or intramuscular routes.  Diagnostic Signs and symptoms • Muscle rigidity • Fever • Altered consciousness • Mutism • Dysphagia • Diaphoresis • Tachycardia • Labile blood pressure • Tremor • Incontinence • Leukocytosis • Laboratory evidence of muscle injury: increase in creatinine kinase levels.  Pharmacological Treatment A: diazepam10 mg (IV)   OR C: lorazepam (IM/IV) 2 mg for immediate sedative or hypnotic action. If no response gives a second dose    OR C: bromocriptine (PO) 2.5 mg 8hourly   Note • NMS is a clinical emergency, It needs ICU care • It is important to stop the antipsychotics immediately • Supportive measures such as bed rest and controlling the hyperthermia by rapid cooling with the help of tepid water spray and via direct fluid replacement should be started immediately • Consideration of ventilator support or intubation would be necessary if the patient has severe breathing difficulties 	
559		 23.22. Somatic Symptom Disorder DSM-5 diagnostic criteria • One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life. • Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following: o Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symptoms. o Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms. o Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns DSM-5 specified time duration of at least 6 months of the presentations. Non-pharmacological Treatment  • Regular appointments: Patients diagnosed with somatic symptom disorder should have a fixed, regular physician whom they can seek help from and be seen on a regular basis. • Avoid unnecessary investigation but physical examination should be performed if new complaints arise. •  Offer empathy to the sufferings experienced by the patient. • Psychotherapy: o Self-help techniques o Supportive   psychotherapy o Cognitive behaviour therapy (e.g. challenge cognitive distortions, activity scheduling to enhance physical activities). • Increase in social and occupational functioning Pharmacological Treatment  A: amitriptyline (PO) 25-50mg 24hourly (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution)   OR  C: imipramine (PO) 100mg 24hourly (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution)  OR S: fluoxetine (PO) 10-20mg 24hourly (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution)    23.24. Conversion Disorder DSM-5 Diagnostic criteria  • One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function. • Clinical findings provide evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions. • The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder. • The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation  Non-pharmacological Treatment • Psycho-education • Cognitive-psychotherapy  Pharmacological Treatment A: amitriptyline (PO) 25-50mg 24hourly (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution)  OR  C: imipramine100mg (PO) once a day (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution)   OR S: fluoxetine (PO)10-20mg 24hourly (medications should be titrated according to symptoms resolution).

Note • A maximum reduction of 1000kcal daily is required to lose about 1kg a week and a reduction. Drastic reduction of calorie intake is however not advisable. • Diet adjustments should be gradual as such people experience excessive appetite. Use of appetite suppressants is not recommended  Dietary considerations in the management of obesity and overweight Proteins Give slightly higher than normal as it gives a feeling of satiety and helps to maintain a good nutritional status yet excess is deaminated. Provide approximately 20% of total energy from proteins. This should include good quality proteins, lean and whole pulses. Fats Provide 20% or less of total energy from fats. Emphasize on the use of unsaturated fats to reduce the risk of heart problems. Restrict or avoid fried foods Carbohydrates 	
568		Provide the rest of energy 60% from carbohydrates which should be mainly in complex form; starches and dietary fiber. Limit simple forms like sugars  Minerals and Vitamins Provide adequate amount of essential nutrients like minerals and vitamins to maintain a good nutrition status  Generally, increase intake of the following food: • Vegetables such as broccoli, mushroom, zucchini, cabbage, lettuce, cucumber • Fruits such as pineapple, cherimoya, peach, grapefruit • Tubers such as sweet potatoes • Low fat milk • Diuretic foods such as celery, apples, watermelon (diuretic drugs are not recommended) 24.7 Nutritional Management in TB, HIV and AIDS • Maintain and improve nutrition status of a person living with HIV/ AIDS thus delay the progression from HIV to AIDS related diseases. • Ensure adequate intake of all nutrients thus preventing development of nutritional deficiencies. • Preservation of lean body mass. • Maintain body weight and fitness. • Improve performance of immune system. • Replenishment of nutrient losses incurred during infection. • Minimizing symptoms of malabsorption. • Regeneration of glycogen stores. • Maintain laboratory values within normal limits.  Note Control side effects due to medication and monitor drug – nutrient interaction  Table 24.9: Side Effects related to TB drugs and food intake recommendations to minimize them.

569		24.7.1 Nutrient Requirements and Dietary Management in TB, HIV and AIDS Patients Energy Most patients with chronic tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS are malnourished, energy needs are increased in order to minimize weight loss and achieve a desirable weight. An additional 300- 500 kcal (35 -40 kcal per ideal body weight) is recommended. This will help in protein sparing.  Protein An intake of 1.2- 1.5 g of protein per kg body weight is required to generate serum albumin levels per day, due to tissue wasting and repair of worn out tissues.  Fats/ oils These should provide 25-30% or less of the total energy requirements of an individual.  Vitamins and minerals The body should be provided with liberal amounts of vitamins and minerals. In TB conversion of beta carotene to retinol is affected in the intestinal mucosa. The client should be supplemented with vitamin A (as per the National Vitamin A supplementation schedule) and encouraged to eat vitamin A rich food. Patients on isoniazid should ideally be supplemented with 10mg of pyridoxine B6 daily since the drug inhibits its absorption. Additional amounts of vitamin C is recommended in the diet to facilitate healing of lesions. Other antioxidants (Vit A, C, and E, folic acid, zinc and selenium) neutralize free radicals and prevent the production of peroxides from lipids.  Water At least 8 glasses or more of safe drinking water per day 24.8 Dumping Syndrome. It is a rapid gastric emptying occurs when food especially sugar moves from stomach into small bowel too quickly.  Nutritional implications • Loss of nutrients • Weight loss  Aims of nutrition management • Provide adequate calories and nutrients to support tissue healing • Prevent weight loss • Correct hypoglycaemia in the short term  Dietary Management After surgery the following should be done: • All fluids and foods by mouth should be withheld for 3 to 5 days and the patient fed by nasogastric tube • Ice chips should be held in mouth or small, infrequent sips of water should be given. Some people tolerate warm water better than ice chips or cold water • Low carbohydrates, clear liquids such as soups, or diluted unsweetened fruit juices should be given and limited to ½ to 1 cup servings, however, at least 6 cups of fluids should be consumed daily to replace losses resulting from diarrhoea. Carbonated beverages and milk are not recommended in the initial stages of the diet • The post-gastrotomy diet then begins with gradual progression to a general diet as tolerated. Bland foods should be started first, but a more important priority is offering the patient foods he/she likes and can tolerate. By the 5th to 7th day most patients can tolerate solid foods • For persons near desirable body weight about 1.5g to 2g protein should be given (35Kcal to 45Kcal/kg) 	
570		• Pectin, a dietary fibre found in fruits and vegetables maybe helpful in treating dumping syndrome. Pectin delays gastric emptying, slow carbohydrate absorption and reduces glycemic response, though small dry meals are of more benefit • Vitamin and mineral supplementation maybe necessary depending on the extent of surgery and whether the symptoms of dumping syndrome persist • Generally, liquids are served between meals rather than with meals to slow the passage of the food mass. Limit simple carbohydrates • Lie down immediately after eating to help slow the transit of food to the intestines. Clients who experience reflux should not lie down after eating. Beware that lactose intolerance may develop and produce discomfort in relation to milk and milk products.  24.9 Dietary Management in Diabetes Mellitus There are two main types of diabetes mellitus; Type I and Type II Type I Usually under 30 years but can present at any age, present acutely, with weight loss and ketonuria: treated with diet and insulin. Type II Usually over 30 years, insidious onset, frequently obese: treated with diet and oral anti-diabetic agents. 40% will eventually require insulin treatment.  Dietary control and weight loss plays an important part in the management of diabetes mellitus. Many Type II diabetics are overweight. Reducing body weight through careful control of energy intake and physical activity like walking helps to control the symptoms. General eating guidance when on Insulin: • In Type I diabetes, when initiating treatment, the starting dose of insulin is 0.5-1.0units /kg/day. Doses should be given about 30 minutes before meals.  • Ideally a “basal/bolus” regimen should be used where basal (intermediate acting) insulin is taken at bedtime and 6-8u of soluble insulin (bolus) taken 3 times a day before meals. This regimen allows more flexibility with meals as the soluble insulin dose can be varied according to what is to be eaten and can be given at different times.   • Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recommended (range 5-7mmol/litre), and the patient can be taught to adjust doses appropriately based on results. • Insulin treatment often leads to weight gain; hence patients need to follow a healthy diet and it is recommended that patients should not change dietary and medicine regimens simultaneously. • Select an insulin schedule best suited to the individual patient’s eating pattern, physical activity and general lifestyle. Diabetic Diet Dietician should calculate dietary requirements for individual patients in order to reduce the blood sugar to normal and to maintain a constant blood sugar level. § 45-50% of energy intake should be in the form of complex carbohydrates than simple sugars with adequate intake of fibers. § Carbohydrates and calories should be taken in equal portions through the day with addition of snacks between meals. § Alcohol is NOT RECOMMENDED in Diabetics as it can induce low blood sugars. § Avoid intake of sugar and sugar-containing food/drinks with the exception of patient feels faint or is ill and cannot eat normally. § Encouraged exercise and a snack should be taken before and after playing sport. § Encourage take of other balanced group of foods at right proportion as per individual patients’ dosage regimen. § Encourage change of life style and regular general body check-up such eyes and oral dental care 	
571		 24.10 Nutrition Care and Support in the Intensive Care The goal of nutrition management is to preserve lean body mass  Oral Nutrition Supplement Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) should be used whenever possible to meet patient’s needs, when dietary counseling and food fortification are not sufficient to increase dietary intake and reach nutritional goals.  Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition Where nutritional requirements cannot be met orally or, expected to be impossible >3 days or expected to be below half of energy requirements for >1 week, enteral nutrition (EN) should be administered. This should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and the long-term impact of nutrition deficit considered.  Parenteral nutrition (PN) Parenteral nutrition (PN) should be considered when EN is not indicated or unable to reachtargets over 3-7 days despite use of appropriate management strategies, and calorie and protein delivery is consistently <50% of prescribed targets. Supplemental PN should be considered after other measures to improve EN have been attempted or insertion of a post-pyloric enteral feeding tube is deemed unsafe and calorie and protein intake remain significantly less than prescribed targets (i.e. <50% over a 3-7day period)  Table 24.10 Oral Nutrition Supplements  Drinks Name Amount Calories  Protein Indication Contraindications  Fresubin drink 2kcal 200mls  400kcal 20g • Inadequate intake of meals  • Chronic wasting • Liver disease  • Not suitable for children <3yrs • Use with caution in children < 6yrs  • Not suitable in patients with galactosemia Supportan drink 200mls  300kcal 20g • Oncology • Cachexia  • Acute or chronic respiratory conditions  • Immuno compromised • Not suitable for children <3yrs • Use with caution in children < 6yrs  • Not suitable I patients with galactosemia Diben drink  200mls  300kcal 20g For diabetic patients -Hyperglycemia  - insulin resistance - Impared glucose tolerance • Not suitable for children <3yrs • Use with caution in children < 6yrs  Not suitable in patients with galactosemia Powder formular Lifegain nutrition supplement (sachet) 30g 120 15g For building and regaining strength Note: To be used with caution to diabetic patients • Not suitable for children <12yrs • Not suitable for patients with soy or milk protein allergy  Maxvida  30g 122 4 Adults  •

573		CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE POISONING  Poison is any substance (liquid, solid, gas), that is harmful to the body, when ingested, inhaled, injected or absorbed through the skin. There is a variability of the clinical presentation and poisonings vary by nature of poison, victims’ age group, intention, geographic region, and level of economic development. Poisons can be classified according to whether the chemical is metallic versus nonmetallic, organic versus inorganic, or acidic versus alkaline.  25.1 Common Poisons  The common poisoning in our setting are:  • Household agents:  o Organophosphate e.g malathion (insecticide) o Pesticides - nuvan top, rat poison, hydrocarbons e.g kerosene o Disinfectants and bleach • Medicines – Acetylsalicylic Acid, Paracetamol, Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine), Hematinic (Iron and Vitamins),  • Major tranquilizers and herbal products  • Foods-eg Mushroom, infected foods  25.2 General Principles of Management of Poisoning In managing a patient who has been exposed to toxins holistic approach should be considered. These include.  Resuscitation and stabilization • Airway, breathing and circulation should be reassessed and treated accordingly as a priority. Refer Approach to patient with Emergency conditions chapter.  Note • A low respiratory rate with decreased oxygen saturations may indicate hypoventilation. A normal saturation does not exclude hypercarbia or indeed hypoxia in carbon monoxide poisoning. If in any doubt, arterial blood gases should be measured. Tachypnoea can be seen with metabolic acidosis (e.g. tricyclics, methanol), anxiety, and stimulant drug overdose and as an early feature of salicylate poisoning (respiratory alkalosis). • Supplementary oxygen via facemask should be given to all patients initially, taking account of pulse oximetry (noting the limitations described above). • Many drugs exhibit cardiovascular toxicity hypotension and or cardiac arrhythmias in overdose (e.g. tricyclics, b-blockers, digoxin, lithium). ECG should be recorded, intravenous access established and initial fluid resuscitation given as appropriate • General examination may give corroborating evidence of significant ingestions or clues in unknown overdoses (SSRIs, tricyclics, phenothiazines) have serotonergic or anticholinergic effects with pupil dilatation, and extrapyramidal movements, whilst opioid type drugs will cause sedation and pin point pupils.  • Temperature, blood glucose (low in b-blocker, ethanol poisoning)  •  Weight is important in identifying a toxic dose against the weight and may guide treatment, for example in paracetamol overdose. •  Examination for injury (intentional or un-intentional self-harm) suggest appropriate methods for treatment, or the presence of other substances such as alcohol. • If clinical condition allows, an assessment of the patient’s mental state should be made.  Use the tabulated Toxidromes to identify toxins and apply the antidotes        	
574		Table 25.1 Common Toxidromes to help identification of toxins.

History may be inaccurate and hence the following laboratory tests should usually be obtained for guidance: • Complete blood count • Liver function test • Serum lactate • Arterial blood gas • Electrocardiogram • Urine pregnancy test in all women of childbearing age  • Basic serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine  Sympathomimetics investigations - RBG-bedside, ECG, Serum electrolytes and Renal function test, Liver function test, Creatinine kinase, Clotting screen: PT/PTT/INR, Full Blood Count, Arterial blood gas, Serum osmolality and osmolality gap. Abdominal X-ray may be useful in diagnosing. Cholinergic investigations - Glucose, BUN, Electrolytes, Prothrombin time, Liver function test, Cholinesterase measurements  Measurement of drug or toxin concentrations in body fluids is not required in most poisonings, but in some exposures, it does influence management. The list of drug concentrations that may assist patient assessment and management are shown here; 	
576		 Table 25.3: List of drugs or toxins requiring measurement of drug concentrations. Paracetamol Methanol Carbamazepine Methotrexate Carbon monoxide Organophosphorus Digoxin Paraquat Ethanol Phenobarbital Ethylene glycol Phenytoin Iron Salicylate Lithium Theophylline Methemoglobin Valproic acid  Table 25.4: Supportive Care Toxic Feature Methods to reach Diagnosis Immediate Stabilization Definitive Management Signs of  COPD H&P, CXR O2, NIPPV Bronchodilators, steroids Pulmonary edema H&P, CXR, pro-BNP O2, NIPPV Nitrates, diuretics Pulmonary embolism H&P, d-dimer, chest CT O2 Anticoagulation, thrombolysis (massive PE only) Acute respiratory distress syndrome H&P, CXR O2, NIPPV Ventilatory  support Myocardial infarction H&P, ECG O2, nitrates, aspirin, anticoagulation Revascularization (thrombolysis or PCI) Metabolic acidosis H&P, metabolic panel, blood gas O2 Directed at underlying cause  Psychosocial Intervention • The investigations depend on the poison ingested: • If the toxin cannot be identified, then toxidrome (signs and symptoms) can be used   25.2.2 Management of Ingested Poisons Ingested toxins are suspected in any patient with signs and symptoms irrespective of reported dose ingested  Clinical Presentations  • General clinical features: Nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, blurred vision, and dizziness • Central Nervous System toxicity: Altered level of consciousness, convulsions, acute confusion and coma, • Renal Toxicity:  Acute kidney injury/failure and papillary necrosis • Metabolic derangement: Metabolic acidosis, respiratory acidosis, hypoglycemia. • Allergic reactions: Urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis • Haematological toxicity: Aplastic anaemia, agranulocytosis    Non-pharmacological Treatment Gastric decontamination - practice of functionally removing an ingested toxin from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in order to decrease its absorption it includes gastric evacuation (forced emesis or gastric lavage), intra-gastric binding (most commonly by single or multidose activated charcoal), or speeding transit of toxins to decrease total absorption time (whole bowel irrigation or cathartics).GI decontamination is most likely to benefit patients who present for care soon after ingestion (usually within one to two hours). • Gastric Lavage • General care: Keep the patient under observation 4–24 hours depending on the poison swallowed.  Contraindications to Gastric Lavage: • An unprotected airway in an unconscious patient • Ingestion of corrosives or petroleum products e.g. kerosene • Bowel obstruction 	
577		• Bowel perforation • GI bleeding • Identify the specific agent and remove or adsorb it as soon as possible.  Note  • Treatment is most effective if given as quickly as possible after the poisoning event, ideally within 1 hour. • If the patient has swallowed kerosene, petrol, or petrol-based products (note that most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents) or if the patient’s mouth and throat have been burned (for example with bleach, toilet cleaner or battery acid) do not vomit the patient but give water orally? Never use salt as an emetic as this can be fatal.  Pharmacological Treatment A: activated charcoal (PO) single dose (if available) within one hour of ingestion and do not induce vomiting; given by mouth or NG tube according to the dosage below:  Dose:  Children below one year: 1g/kg Children 1-12 years of age: 25–50g Adolescents and adults: 25–100g A: compound sodium lactate or 0.9% sodium chloride (IV) 30ml/kg 2liters for 24hours if Shock is present Note Toxins for which multiple doses of activated charcoal are indicated includes Carbamazepine, Dapsone, Digoxin, Paraquat, Phenobarbitone, Quinine, Slow-release preparations such as theophylline, Amanita phalloides fungus, Multiple doses may also be considered in life threatening overdose of other drugs (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants).  Content mixing:  • Mix the charcoal in 8–10 times the amount of water, e.g. 5g in 40 ml of water. • If possible, give the whole amount at once; if the child has difficulty in tolerating it, the charcoal dose can be divided. • If charcoal is not available, then induce vomiting but only if the patient is conscious by rubbing the back of the patient throat with a spatula or spoon handle;   Referral: Consider transferring patient to next referral level hospital, where this can be done safely, if the patient is: • Unconscious or deteriorating conscious level • Burns to mouth and throat • Severe respiratory distress • Cyanosed • Heart failure  25.2.3 Food Poisoning Food poisoning, also called foodborne illness, is illness caused by eating contaminated food. Infectious organisms — including bacteria, viruses, and parasites — or their toxins are the most common causes of food poisoning as listed in the table. Large intestine and small intestine have an intermediate incubation from about 1 to 3 days.  Large intestine Infections of the large intestine or colon can cause bloody, mucousy diarrhea associated with crampy abdominal pain. • Campylobacter spp, is the common one cause of food-borne disease  • Shigella spp contaminate food and water and cause dysentery (severe diarrhea often containing mucus and blood). • Salmonella spp infections often occur because of poorly or undercooked cooked and/or poor handling of the chicken and eggs. In individuals with weakened immune systems, including the elderly, the infection can enter the bloodstream and cause potentially life-threatening infections. • Vibrio parahaemolyticus can contaminate saltwater shellfish and cause a watery diarrhea. 	
578		 Small Intestine Infection Diarrhea due to small bowel infection tends not to be bloody, but infections may affect both the small and large intestine at the same time. • E. coli (enterotoxigenic) is the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. It lacks symptoms such as fever or bloody diarrhea. • Vibrio cholerae, often from contaminated drinking, water produces a voluminous watery diarrhea resembling rice-water. • Viruses such as Norwalk, rotavirus and adenovirus tend to have other symptoms associated with an infection including fever, chills, headache, and vomiting. • Botulism is caused by Clostridium botulinum toxin and may present with fever, vomiting, mild diarrhea, numbness, and weakness leading to paralysis.  Pharmacological Treatment Adult: A:  0.9% sodium chloride 30mL every 30minutes; not to exceed 8-10doses AND C: loratadine 10mg (PO) 24hourly Children2 to 5 years: A:  0.9% sodium chloride 7.5-15mL every 30minutes; not to exceed 8-10doses AND C: loratadine 5mg (PO) 24hourly AND Antibiotics based on the infection suspected.   25.2.4 Herbal Poisoning Investigations • Basic blood count, renal function, liver function, and electrocardiogram • Heavy metal screening if suspected or if symptoms are non-specific • Analysis methods exist for some herbal toxins only—Colchicines (HPLC, GCMS), tropane alkaloids (GCMS, oxalate (GCMS), vinca alkaloids (HPLC), cardioactive steroids (immunoassay)—check with local laboratory  Table25.5 Organ Toxicities and Toxidromes, and Common Dietary Supplements or Herbal Medicines that can cause them Clinical features Xenobiotics Cardiac Sodium channel effects—Aconitum species (widen QRS, shock) Digoxin-like effects—Digitalis species, bufo toads Central nervous system Seizures—strychnine, thujone, essential oils (camphor, eucalyptus) Sedation—Valeriana species, kava kava Dermatological Blistering—cantharidin (Chinese blister beetle) Hematological Coagulopathies—G-herbs (ginger, garlic, gingko) Agranulocytosis—anti-mitotic agents (colchicine, podophyllotoxin) Hepatotoxic Hepatitis—multiple agents, germander commonly reported Veno-occlusive disease—pyrrolizidine alkaloids (comfrey, Senecio species, Heliotropium species) Nephrotoxic Renal failure—Aristolochia species Hypertension, hyperkalemia—licorice Anticholinergic Datura metel commonly used in TCM Hexing herbs (Atropa species, Hyoscyamus species, Mandrago officinarum) common in Western herbal practice Sympathomimetic Ephedra species, Citrus aurantium (bitter orange) Salicylate poisoning Willow bark, checkerberry   	
579		Non-Pharmacological Treatment • Ask specifically regarding the use of such products and a matched clinical feature using the above Toxidrome • Secure sample for identification o Actual herbs or product used o Prescription or packaging • Good resuscitative, symptomatic, and supportive care • Instruct patients and family to stop using the product • Consider outpatient monitoring of renal function, liver function, and blood counts • Report case to regulating authority • Report unusual cases to National Poison Control Center   Pharmacological Treatment Use antidote if appropriate, activated charcoal can be given in an acute overdose of toxic dietary supplements and herbal medicines if there is adequate airway protection.

Evert the eyelids and ensure that all surfaces are rinsed. • In the case of an acid or alkali irrigate for 30 minutes and review for possible next 30 minutes • Where possible, the eye should be thoroughly examined under fluorescein staining for signs of corneal damage.  • If there is significant conjunctival or corneal damage, the patient should be seen urgently by an ophthalmologist.  • Refer when further eye evaluation cannot be performed.  25.2.7 Management of Inhaled Poisoning • Move the patient to the fresh air immediately. Victims to stay away from all toxic fumes and gases.  • Thoroughly ventilate the involved area Administer supplemental oxygen if cyanosis or difficulty in breathing  • Mild distress/ hypoxia gives 24–40% oxygen at a flow rate of 2–6 L/min (LPM), (nasal canula)  • Moderate distress/ hypoxia gives 24–50% oxygen at a variable flow of 6 -10 L/min (Face mask / Venture mask)  • Severe distress/ hypoxia gives 50–90% oxygen at 10-15L/min (Non-rebreather Mask / face mask with reservoir bag)  • Apnea give nearly 100% oxygen at 10-15L/min (Bag valve Mask “BVM” device) Oxygen flow should be moderated to achieve oxygen saturation levels, based on pulse oximetry (with a target level of 94–96% in most, or 88–92% in people with COPD)  Apply Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if there are signs of cardiac arrest  LoE	580Inhalation of irritant gases may cause swelling and upper  airway obstruction, bronchospasm  and

25.3.2 Petroleum Compounds  Poisoning 
Examples—Kerosene, Turpentine substitutes and petro l 
 Clinical Present ation: 
• GIT-abdom inal pain, bloody stool, vomiting  
• RS-Throat swelling, pneum onitis and/or pulmonary oedem a-cough,  tachypnea,  cyanos is, 
crepitation and r honc hi 
• CNS -Headac he, dizziness,  euphor ia, restlessness,  ataxia, convul sion, encephal opathy

Non-pharmacological Treatment 
• Remove t he patient fr om source 
• Remove contaminated cloth and t horoughl y wash the skin with soap and water 
• Give suppl emental oxygen 2–6litres per minute (LPM), deliver ing a concentration of 24–
40% oxygen (nasal cannul a) or 28–50% oxygen (face mask) 40–70% oxygen (face mask 
with reservoir bag) 
• Oxygen flow shoul d be moderated to achieve oxygen saturation levels, based on pulse 
oximetry (with a target level of 94–96% in most, or 88–92% in peopl e with COP D) 
• If large amount of petroleum compound has been ingest ed less than an hour earlier lavage 
may be consi dered and t he patient shoul d be intubated 
 
Note 
Do notinduc e vomiting or use activated charcoal  	
581		 Kerosene (Paraffin) Poisoning There is a higher risk of kerosene poisoning among children. The respiratory system is the main target organ affected. Pneumonia is in most cases interstitial and bilateral. Vomiting after hydrocarbon ingestion is related to the rate of development of pneumonia; Symptoms of CNS impairment correlated with hypoxemia, pneumonia, and fever.  Non-pharmacological Treatment • Immediately remove the child from the source of the poisoning and ensure the airway is open (this is always the first priority). • Remove contaminated clothing and thoroughly wash the skin with soap and water. • If possible, perform pulse oximetry and give supplemental oxygen if indicated. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be needed in a patient with severe hypoxia, respiratory distress or decreased consciousness.   • Avoid gastric lavage because of the risk of inhalation and hence pneumonitis. If very large amounts of kerosene have been ingested less than an hour earlier then lavage may be considered if the airway can be protected by expert intubation.   Pharmacological Treatment, A: compound sodium Lactate OR 0.9% sodium chloride (IV) 30ml/kg 2liters for 24hours if Shock is present  Note There is no evidence that corticosteroids are helpful in kerosene poisoning  25.3.3 Organo-Phosphorus and Carbamate Compounds Poisoning Organophosphates and carbamates are common insecticides that inhibit cholinesterase activity, causing acute muscarinic manifestations (e.g., salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, emesis, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, miosis) and some nicotinic symptoms, including muscle fasciculation and weakness.  These can be absorbed through the skin, ingested or inhaled. Examples:  • Organophosphorus – Malathion, Parathion, Tetraethyl Pyrophosphate (TEPP), mevinphos and  • Carbamates – methiocarb and carbaryl.  Clinical presentations • Vomiting, diarrhoea, blurred vision or weakness. • Signs of excess parasympathetic activation: salivation, sweating, lacrimation, slow pulse, small pupils, convulsions, muscle weakness/twitching, then paralysis and loss of bladder control, pulmonary oedema, and respiratory depression.  Non-pharmacological Treatment  • Remove poison by irrigating eye or washing skin (if in eye or on skin)  • Give activated charcoal if ingested and within 1 hour of the ingestion. • Do not induce vomiting because most pesticides are in petrol-based solvents. • In a serious ingestion where activated charcoal cannot be given, consider careful aspiration of stomach contents by NG tube (the airway should be protected). • Auscultate the chest for signs of respiratory secretions and monitor respiratory rate, heart rate and coma score (if appropriate) • Give oxygen saturation is less than 90%  Pharmacological Treatment If there are signs of excess parasympathetic activation (see above) give: A: atropine (IV) boluses of 5mg  o Repeat every 10minutes until satisfactory atropinization (i.e. no chest signs of secretions, HR>80b/min, Systolic BP >80mmHg, pupils no longer pinpoint, Dry axillae)  o Paediatric patient can start at 0.05mg/kg, then double the dose every five minutes, stop doubling the dose when parameters have improved. If muscle weakness gives:  S: pralidoxime (IV) (cholinesterase reactivator) 50mg/kg diluted with 15ml water by infusion over 30 minutes 582o Repeat ed once to twice. 
o Followed by 10–20 mg/kg/hour, as necessary.

585		Note • Syrup of ipecac is contraindicated in inducing vomiting to control paracetamol overdose because the vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine  25.3.5 Acetylsalicylic Acid and other Salicylates Poisoning. Clinical Presentation  • Initial signs and symptoms o Tinnitus and impaired hearing, rapid breathing (acidotic-like breathing), vomiting, dehydration, fever, double vision and feeling faint • Late signs o Drowsiness, bizarre behavior o Unsteady walking and coma  Investigations • Blood gases • pH and bicarbonates  • Serum electrolytes (Calcium and Magnesium) • An ECG to evaluate for dysrhythmias • ABG,  • LFTs,  • Full Blood Picture (Leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia) • Coagulation studies (PT and PTT)  Non-pharmacological Treatment • Give activated charcoal within one hour of ingestion if available. If charcoal is not available and a severely toxic dose has been given, then perform gastric lavage or induce vomiting as above • Monitor blood glucose every 6 hours and correct as necessary  • Monitor urine pH hourly.  Pharmacological Treatment C: Fluid resuscitation:  If hypokalemia, give  A: compound sodium lactate (IV) 1litre for 24hr if CNS hypoglycemia is seen give bolus of 20 mL 50% Dextrose then 5% Dextrose 1litre for 24hours  AND C: sodium bicarbonate (IV) 1mmol/kg over 4hours to correct acidosis and to raise the pH of the urine to above 7.5 so that salicylate excretion is increased.   AND C: potassium chloride (IV) 8.4mEq/ml, maintain fluids until urine output is 2-3 mL/kg per hour  Replace fluid losses (Plasma potassium concentration should be corrected before giving sodium bicarbonate as hypokalaemia may complicate alkalinization of urine) Give; A: 0.9% sodium chloride (IV) as maintenance requirements  OR Hemodialysis is required if the concentration exceeds 700mg/liter or in presence of severe metabolic acidosis  25.3.6 Iron Poisoning Symptoms appear at doses greater than 20mg/kg.  Iron levels above 350–500µg/dL are considered toxic, and levels over 1000µg/dL indicate severe iron poisoning.Iron pills can look like candy to children. Intentional overdose can occur among adults, but is rare.   Clinical Presentations  • Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.  • The vomitus and stools are often grey or black.  • In severe poisoning there may be gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hypotension, drowsiness, convulsions and metabolic acidosis. • In a child, bloody vomit or stool gastrointestinal features usually appear in the first 6 hours and a patient who has remained asymptomatic for this time probably does not require antidote treatment. 586	Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Gastric lavage if potentially toxic amounts of iron were taken.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Give antidote  
D: deferoxamine (IM) 50mg/kg up to a maximum of 1g by repeated every 12hours; if very 
ill, give (IV) infusion 15mg/kg/hour to a maximum of 80mg/kg in 24hours.  
25.3.7 Carbon- monoxide Poisoning  
Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of burning organic compounds, and may of its exposure occur in 
private residences. So its toxicity is usually due to improper use of gasoline portable generators and indoor use of charcoal f or cooking and heating.  
Clinical Presentations  
• Common presentations includes "flu-like" and commonly include  headache,  dizziness ,
weakness, vomiting,  chest pain,
• Dizziness, nausea or vomiting
• Shortness of breath, blurred vision, loss of consciousness
Large exposures can result in loss of consciousness, arrhythmias, seizures, or death  
Investigations  
• Blood gases and serum electrolytes
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Give 100% oxygen at 10 -15L/min (BVM device) to accelerate removal of 50% car bon
monoxide (note patient can look pink but still be hypoxemic) until signs of hypoxiadisappear.
• Those who are unconscious may require  CPR on site.

25.3.8 Opioid Poison ing 
Physical and mental symptoms that occur after taking too many opioids, a substance found in 
certain prescription pain medication and illegal drugs like heroin. It is caused by complications of substance abuse, unintentional overdose, Intentional overdo se, and Therapeutic drug error any time 
from birth (Delivery/ maternal opioid usage) to terminal care. Drugs involved in substance abuseincludes: Codeine, Diamorphene, Di Hydrocodeine, Fentanyl, Heroin, Loperamide, Methadone, Morphine, opium, Tramadol (etc.) alone or in combination.  
Risk factors for Toxicity  
• Drug users
• Social disadvantaged• People who had used the drug
earlier for treatment
• Those using alcohol and othersedatives
Clinical Presentation 
• Acute toxicity: drowsiness, nausea and vomiting
• Chron ic toxicity: constipation, loss of appetite± nausea and vomiting
• Respiratory depression, tachycardia, hypotension and pin point pupils
Laboratory Investigations  
• Full Blood Picture
• Liver Function Test (ALAT and
ASAT)  • Renal Function Test (Serum
Creatinine and Blood Urea 
Nitrogen, BUN)  
• Creatinine kinase level
• Arterial blood gas determinations587	• An ECG is recommended in all
patients with suspected opioid overdose.  
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Check the airway
• Intubate the patient who cannot protect their ai rway
• Give oxygen as described above.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Antidote:  Hypoventilating patient with spontaneous ventilation Naloxone 
Adults & children> 20kg:  
B: naloxone (IV)  Initial dose 0.5mg titrated upward until Respiratory Rate is ≥ 12 
Children (<20kg): 0.01mg/kg (IV) (Maximum 2mg/dose), increase till hypoventilation resolves  
Note  
• The starting dose of naloxone is between 0.4 to 1 mg in adults and 0.1 mg/kg in children. I n
suspected chronic opiate abusers
• Naloxone must be administered slowly at doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mg IV every 1 to 3 minutes to
ensure a more controlled reversal of the opiate effects. If the naloxone is administer ed
rapidly in these patients, the patient may also start to feel the pain which was bei ng
suppressed by the opiate.
• If the respiration is shallow, administer 100% oxygen or assisted with bag -valve ventilati on
until patient becomes more alert and cooperative.
• The onset of action of naloxone is immedi ate with a peak response observed within 3 to 8
minutes.
• A repeat dose may be indicated if the patient still shows signs of opiate toxicity
Patients with apnoea:  
• Newborn with apnoea secondary to maternal opioid: 0.01mg/kg (IV/IM) (Maximum
0.4mg/kg/dose)
• Children: <20kg 0.1mg/kg (Maximum 2mg/dose) start then repeat doses with continuousinfusion as required
.
• Adults and children>20kg Higher dose of naloxone (0.2 -1mg and titrate to clinical response
For life threatening Opioid toxicity  
• Pediatrics (< 20kg)  dosing: 0.1mg/kg/IV (Maximum 2mg/dose). Repeat dose/continuous
infusion as required
• Adults and children (More than 20kg): 2mg IV.
o The dose should be repeated every 3 min until improvement of Respiratory Distress
Syndrome
o If maximal cumulative dose of 10 mg is reached and the respiratory insufficiency has
not improvement, consider other pathology
Note  
Withdrawal reaction might be life threatening in neonatal period, hence low doses should be given.

25.3.9 Heavy Metal Poisoning  
Lead Poisoning  
Lead is a heavy metal, ubiquitous in our environment (Lead- based paint and its dust, in older 
buildings ) that has no physiologic role in biological systems. Lead poisoning occurs when lead builds 
up in the body, often over months or years.  Lead toxicity is a particularly insidious hazard with the 
potential of causing irreversible health effects associated with chronic toxicity.  
Clinical Presentation  
The clinical presentat ion varies widely, depending upon the age at exposure, the amount of 
exposure, and the duration of exposure  
• New born: Be born prematurely, have  lower birth weight, slowed growth ,588	• Children: Developmental delay, Learning difficulties, Irritability, Loss of appetite, Weight
loss, Sluggishness and fatigue, Abdominal pain, Vomiting, Constipation, Hearing loss ,
Seizures, Eating things, such as paint chips, that aren't food (pica), lower IQ , anxiety,
depression and ADHD Like symptoms
• Adults: High blood pressure,  joint and muscle pain, difficulties with memory or
concentration, headache, abdominal pain, mood disorders, reduced sperm count andabnormal sperm, miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth in pregnant women, anaemia,
Fanconi’s syndrome, wrist drop
Laboratory Investigations  
• Lead blood levels > 10 µg/dL
• Free erythrocyte protoporphyri
n
(FEP) level  
• Erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) >
35µg/dL 
• FBC
• Liver Function Test (ALAT and
ASAT)  • Renal Function Test (Serum
Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen, 
BUN) 
• Imaging studies according to
presentation, -chest, bones,
abdomen etc are ordered as
appropriate.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Remove the source of lead exposure in the community
• Closely monitor cardiovascular and mental status

Mercury Toxicity  
Mercury in any form is poisonous. Poisoning can result from mercury vapour inhalation, mercury 
injection and absorption of mercury through the skin. Methylmercury (organic mercury) poisoning is largely linked to eating seafood, mercury -containing fish.  
Clinical Presentation 
• Inorganic Mercury:
o Ash-gray mucous membrane, haematochesia, severe abdominal pain, foul breath,
hypovolaemic shock, Metallic taste, stomatitis, gingival irritation loosening of teet
h
and Renal tubular necrosis.
• Organic Mercury:
o Visual disturbances, - Eg, sco tomata, visual field constriction, ataxia, paresthesias
(early signs), hearing loss, dysarthria, mental deterioration, muscle tremor,movement disorders, paralysis, and death (with severe exposure).
Laboratory Investigations:  
• Blood and Urine Mercury level s
• FBC
• RFT• Hair, Toenail, and CSF mercury level
for chronic exposure
• Plain X- ray of the abdomen589	Non-pharmacological Treatment:  
• Remove from the exposure,
• Airway Breathing and Circulation
(ABC)
• Give oxygen
• Copious irrigation of the skin if skin
involve ment• Do gastric lavage if ingested
mercury and observed in t he
abdominal radiographs
• Do Hemodialysis when renalfunction has declined.
Pharmacological Treatment  
Chelati on therapy for acute inorganic mercury poisoning can be done with  DMSA  or 
Dimerca prol.  Occasionally 2,3-dimercapto- 1-propanesulfonic acid  (DMPS),  D-
penicillamine (DPCN).  
A: activated charcoal (PO) as in ingested poisons  
OR 
D: 2,3-dimercapto succinic acid (PO) (DMSA or succimer) 10 mg/kg 8 hourly  for 5 days; 
follow by 10 mg/kg/dose 12 hourly for 14 days; not to exceed 500 mg/dose  
In acute inorganic mercury poisoning:  
D: Dimercaprol:  
o Day 1: 5mg/kg deep (IM) stat
o Day 2 –11: 2.5mg deep (IM) 12 hourly for 10 days
Surgical intervention: To remove mercury that has been logged in the intestine or colon  
25.4 Prevention of P oisoning  
Educate the patient on Dos and Don’ts of poisoning prevention.  
Do’s  
• Keep medicines and poison inproper containers and out of reach of
children.
• Use containers with child resistant
caps• Keep all products in their originalcontainer
• Read medicine labels carefully to
avoid mistake
Don’ts  
• Leave container open
• Transfer products from their origin
• Remove labels from the medicineproducts• Put tablets into another container
such as purse or envelope

25.6.1.2 Scorpion Sting (E nvenoming)  
Scorpion stings can be very painful for days. Systemic effects of venom are much more common in 
children than adults.  
Clinical Presentations  
• Local pain and/or paresthesia at the site of envenomation,
• Pain and/or paresthesia remote from the si te of sting ,
• Autonomic disturbances such as tachy/bradycardia, hyper/hypotension, hypersalivation and
lacrimation, urinary and faecal incontinence and pulmonary oedema. 
• Blurred vision, roving eye movement, tongue fasculation, dysphagia, dysphonia, restle ss,
• Severe involuntary shaking or jerking extremities
• Cardiogenic shock
Deaths from  scorpion stings  are usually due to cardiogenic shock and pulmonary oedema.  
Grading of Envenomation  
•Grade I involves local pain and paresthesias at the sting site. The puncture wound may not
be noticeable in this grade.
•Grade II involves local pain and paresthesias existing at the sting site as well as proximal tothe sting site .
•Grade III includes grade 2 classification factors with added cranial nerve (increased or
 al
secretions, blurry vision, rapid tongue movement, nystagmus), or skeletal neuromusculardysfunction (flailing of the extremities and tetanus- like arching of the back) and can also be
accompanied by autonomic dysfunction.
•Grade IV includes both 3 an d hyperthermia, up to 104 ⁰F, rhabdomyolysis, pulmonary
edema, and multiple organ failures.
Non-pharmacological Treatment  
• Provide adequate airway, ventilation and perfusion
• Calm the patient to lower the heart rate and blood pressure, thus limiting the s pread of t he
venom
• Giv
e oxygen as above
• Monitor vitals: oxygen saturation, heart rate respiratory rate and blood pressure
Pharmacological Treatment  
A: Cleaning of the sting area with Normal saline  
AND 
A: compound sodium lactate (IV) 2L for 24hours 
AND 
A: adrenalin (IM) dose of 1:1000 (Repeat after 5 min if no improvement)

If very severe, infiltrate site with  
A: 1% lignocaine. 
25.6.1.3 Snake Bite 
A snake bite can be life -threatening if the snake is venomous. Less than 10% of 3500 snake species 
are poisonous and they include cobras and mamba’s black mamba, king cobra, banded krait, saw-
scaled viper and rattlesnake . (Elapidac), sea snakes (hydrophidac) and the boom slang and vine 
snakes (columbidac). Clinical c condition depends on the type of snake bite and amount of poison 
(venom) injected.   
Hence envenomation (poisoning) are:  
• Neurotoxin in cobra, mambas and sea snakes
• Haemotoxic in vipers and boom slang.
Sn
ake bites should be considered in any severe pain or swelling of a limb or in any unexplained 
illness presenting with bleeding or abnormal neurological signs. Some cobras spit venom into the eyes of victims causing pain and inflammation.  
Table:  25.8 Various snakebites, their fatal dose, quantity of venom injected, and time to 
fatality  
Snake  LD50  in mine  Fatal dose 
for 
humans  Average 
delivered dose 
per bite  Average 
fatal period  
Indian cobra  (Naja naja)  0.28 mg/ kg 12 mg 60 mg 8 h 
Common krait  (Bungarus 
caeruleus)  0.09 mg/kg  6 mg 20 mg 18 h 
Russell's viper  (Daboia russelii)  0.1 mg/kg  15 mg 63 mg 3 days  
Saw- scaled viper  (Echis carinatus)  6.65 mg/kg  8 mg 13–40 mg 41 days  
Clinical Presentations  
• General signs i nclude pain in the affected area, skin redness, swelling, bleeding, bruise,
• fast heart rate, nausea, or sweating  vomiting and headache
• Shock
• Bite for local necrosis, bleeding or tender local lymph node enlargement
592	• Specific signs and level of envomation ar e shown in the table below depending on the
venom and its effects.
Tab
le 25.9: Assessment of severity of Snake envenomation  
Level of Intoxication Presentation 
No envenomation  Absence of local or systemic reacti ons; fang marks (+/ −) 
Mild envenomation Fang marks (+), moderate pain, minimal local edema (0 –15 ce), erythema (+), 
ecchymosis (+/ −), no systemic reactions  
Moderate 
envenomation  Fang marks (+), severe pain, moderate local edema (15 –30 cm), erythema and 
ecchymosis (+), systemic weakness, sweating, syncope, nausea, vomiting, 
anemia, or thrombocytopenia 
Severe envenomation Fang marks (+), severe pain, severe local edema (>30 cm), erythema and 
ecchymosis (+), hypotension, paresthesia, coma, pulmonary edema, 
respiratory failure  
Additionally,  the patient may present with 
• These include:
o Shock
o Local swelling that may gradually extend up the bitten limb
o Bleeding: external from gums, wounds or sores; internal especially intracranial
o Signs of neurotoxicity: respi ratory arrest or paralysis, ptosis, bulbar palsy (difficulty
swallowing and talking), limb weakness
o Signs of muscle breakdown: muscle pains and black urine
Note  
• Avoid picking up the snake or try to wrap it up or kill it, as this will increase your chances  of
getting bitten again. 
• Avoid applying a tourniquet.
• Avoid cutting into the wound at all.
• Avoid trying to suck out the venom.
• Avoid applying ice or use water to submerge the wound.
• Avoid drinking alcohol.
• Avoid drinking beverages with caffeine.
• Avoid taking any pain- relieving medication, such as ibuprofen
Investigations  
Specific investigations  
No specific investigations, history is more useful.  
• The 20 -min whole blood clotting test (20 WBCT)
• Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Supportive invest igations may include 
• Hemogram: Presence of neutrophilic leucocytosis signifies systemic absorption of venom.
Thrombocytopenia may be a feature of viper envenomation.  
• Serum creatinine: This is necessary to rule out renal failure after viper and sea snake b ite.
• Serum amylase and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): Elevated levels of these markers
suggests muscle damage (caution for renal damage).  
• Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): Prolongation may
be present in viper bite.  
• Fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products (FDPs): Low fibrinogen with elevated FDP is
present when venom interferes with the clotting mechanism. 
• Arterial blood gas and electrolyte determinations: These test are necessary for patients with
systemic symptoms.  
• Urine examination: Can reveal hematuria, proteinuria, hemoglobinuria, or myoglobinuria
593	• Electrocardiogram (ECG): Nonspecific ECG changes such as bradycardia and
atrioventricular block with ST -T changes may be seen.  
• Electroencephalogram (EEG): Recently, EEG changes have been noted in up to 96% of
patients bitten by snakes. 
Non-pharmacological Treatment:  
• Reassure the patient;
• Splint the limb to reduce movement and absorption of venom.
• If the bite was likely to have come from a snake with  neurotoxin venom,
o Clean the site with clean water to remove any poison and remove any fangs;
• If any of the above signs, transport to hospital which has  antivenom  as soon as possible.
• Paralysis of respiratory muscles can last for days and requires intubation and mechanical
ventilation or manual ventilation (with a mask or  endotracheal  tube and bag) by relays o f
staff and/or relatives until respiratory function returns.
• Do 
endotracheal intubation +/ - elective tracheotomy .
• Elevate limb if swollen
• Monitor very closely immedia tely after admission, then hourly for at least 24 hours as
envenoming can develop rapidly.
Pharmacological Treatment 
Give  
A: Anti-Tetanus prophylaxis  
Treat shock, if present.  
A: 0.9% sodium chloride (IV)  10–20mls/kg bolus, repeat after 30min if still in shock 
Give fluids orally or by NG tube according to daily requirements. Keep a close record of 
fluid intake and output fluid daily requirements to be inserted  
If there are systemic signs or severe local signs (swelling of more than half of the limb or se vere 
necrosis), give  
A: Anti–snake venom (IV) (ASV)are polyvalent  immunoglobulins prepared to control venom 
of poisonous snakes) using indications shown below. Follow the directions given on the 
antivenom preparation.  
o Dilute antivenom in 2 –3 volumes of 0.9 % Normal saline and give intravenously over 1
hour
o Give more slowly initially and monitor closely for anaphylaxis or other serious adversereactions.
For mild degree of envenomation give 5 vials (50 ml)  
For moderate degree of envenomation give 5 –10 vials (50– 100 ml)  
Fore severe degree of envenomation gives  10–20 vials (100– 200 ml)

or
 IV/SC Chlorpheniramine 250 micrograms/kg.
• When the patient is stable, re -start antivenom infusion slowly.
• More antivenom should be given after 6 hours if there is recurrence of blood in-coagulability
or after 1 –2hour if the patient is continuing to bleed briskly o r has deteriorating  neurotoxin or
cardiovascular signs.
• Blood transfusion should not be required if antivenom is given.
• Response of abnormal neurological signs to antivenom is more variable and depends on
type of venom.
Surgical Intervention 
• Excision of dead tissue from wound
• Incision of facial membranes to relieve pressure in limb compartments, if necessary
• Skin grafting, if extensive necrosis
• Tracheotomy if paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing occurs
